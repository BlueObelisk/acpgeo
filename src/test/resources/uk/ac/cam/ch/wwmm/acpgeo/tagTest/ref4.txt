JJ Global JJ total NN-ACP water NN vapour NNS columns VBP have VBN been VBN derived IN-FROM from NNS measurements IN-OF of DT-THE the JJ Global OSCAR-CM Ozone NNP-ACP Monitoring NNP Experiment CD 2 -LRB- ( NNP-APPARATUS GOME-2 -RRB- ) IN-ON on NNP-SATELLITE MetOp STOP . IN-FOR For DT this NN purpose COMMA , DT-THE the NNP-ACP Air NNP Mass NNP Corrected NNP Differential NNP Optical NN-ACP Absorption NN-METHOD Spectroscopy -LRB- ( NNP-ACRONYM AMC-DOAS -RRB- ) NN-ACP method VBZ has VBN been VBN adapted COMMA , VBG having RB previously VBN been VBN applied RB successfully TO to NNP-APPARATUS GOME -LRB- ( IN-ON on NNP-SATELLITE ERS-2 -RRB- ) CC and NNP-APPARATUS SCIAMACHY -LRB- ( VBG-ACP SCanning NNP Imaging NN-ACP Absorption NNP spectroMeter IN-FOR for NNP Atmospheric NNP CHartographY COMMA , IN-ON on NNP-SATELLITE ENVISAT -RRB- ) NNS data STOP . NNS Comparisons IN-BETWEEN between DT-THE the JJ derived NNP-APPARATUS GOME-2 CC and NNP-APPARATUS SCIAMACHY NN-ACP water NN vapour NNS columns VBP show DT a JJ good JJ overall NN agreement STOP . DT This JJ gives NN confidence JJ that DT-THE the JJ temporal NN series IN-OF of NN-ACP water NN vapour NNS columns IN-FROM from JJ GOME-type NNS instruments -LRB- ( NNP-SATELLITE GOME/ERS-2 COMMA , NNP-SATELLITE SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT -RRB- ) COMMA , WDT which VBD began IN-IN in CD-YEAR 1995 COMMA , VBZ is RB successfully VBN continued IN-BY by DT-THE the NNP-SATELLITE MetOp NN instrumentation IN until IN-AT at JJS least CD-YEAR 2020 STOP . DT-THE The JJ enhanced JJ temporal CC and JJ spatial NN-RESOLUTION resolution IN-OF of NNP-APPARATUS GOME-2 VBZ enables DT-THE the NN analysis IN-OF of JJ-ACP diurnal NNS variations IN-IN in DT-THE the JJ polar NN regions STOP . DT This VBZ is RB especially JJ important IN because JJ atmospheric NNS data NNS sources IN-IN in DT-THE the JJ polar NNS regions VBP are RB generally JJ sparse STOP .
