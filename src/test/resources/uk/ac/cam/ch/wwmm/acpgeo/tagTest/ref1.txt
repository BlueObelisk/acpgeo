PRP We VBP present DT a JJ simple NN-ACP method TO to VB perform NN degradation NN correction TO to JJ Global NN-ACP Ozone NNP-ACP Monitoring NNP Experiment -LRB- ( NNP-ACRONYM GOME -RRB- ) NN-ACP reflectance NN spectra IN-BY by VBG comparing DT-THE the JJ average NN-ACP reflectance IN-FOR for CD-DEGREES 60° NNP-DIRECTION N DASH - CD-DEGREES 60° NNP-DIRECTION S IN-WITH with JJ that IN at DT-THE the NN beginning IN-OF of NNP-ACRONYM GOME NNS observations -LRB- ( NNP-MONTH July-December CD-YEAR 1995 -RRB- ) IN-AFTER after VB-REMOVE removing DT-THE the NNS dependences IN-ON on JJ solar JJ-CHEM zenith NN angle CC and JJ seasonal NN variation STOP . DT-THE The NN results VBP indicate JJ positive NNS biases IN-OF of RB up TO to CD ~15-25 NN-PERCENT % IN-IN in DT-THE the JJ-ACP wavelength NN range CD 289-370 NN nm IN during CD-YEAR-RANGE 2000-2002 STOP ; DT-THE the NN degradation RB also JJ exhibits JJ significant NN dependence IN-ON on NN-ACP wavelength CC and NN viewing IN zenith NN angle STOP . DT These NN results VBP are JJ consistent IN-WITH with JJ previous NNS studies VB-USE using JJ radiative NN transfer NNS models CC and NN-ACP ozone NNS observations STOP . DT-THE The NN degradation VBZ causes JJ retrieval NNS biases IN-OF of RB up TO to CD ~3 NN-PERCENT % -LRB- ( CD 10 NNP DU COMMA , CD 1 CD DU=2.69×10 CD 16 JJ molecules NN cm−2 -RRB- ) COMMA , CD 30 NN-PERCENT % -LRB- ( CD 10 NNP DU -RRB- ) COMMA , CD 10 NN-PERCENT % COMMA , CC and CD 40 NN-PERCENT % IN-IN in NN total NN-COLUMN column NN-ACP ozone COMMA , NN tropospheric NN-COLUMN column NN-ACP ozone COMMA , JJ stratospheric NN-ACP ozone CC and NN tropospheric NN-ACP ozone COMMA , RB respectively COMMA , IN-FROM from PRP$ our NNP-ACRONYM GOME NN-ACP ozone NN profile NN retrieval NN algorithm STOP . IN-IN In NN addition COMMA , JJ retrieval JJ-CHEM biases JJ due TO to NN degradation VBP vary RB significantly IN-WITH with NN latitude STOP . DT-THE The NN application IN-OF of DT this JJ-CHEM degradation NN correction VBZ improves DT-THE the NN-CHEMENTITY retrievals JJ relative TO to NNP Dobson CC and NN ozonesonde NN-MEASUREMENT measurements IN at NNP Hohenpeißenberg NN-STATION station IN during CD-YEAR-RANGE 2000-2003 CC and VBZ improves DT-THE the JJ spatiotemporal NN consistency IN-OF of JJ retrieval NN quality IN during CD-YEAR-RANGE 1996-2003 STOP . RB However COMMA , IN because DT this NN-ACP method VBZ assumes JJ that DT-THE the NN deseasonalized RB globally-averaged NN-ACP reflectance VBZ does NEG not VB change RB much IN-WITH with NN-TIME time COMMA , NN-CHEMENTITY retrievals IN-WITH with DT this NN correction MD may VB be JJ inadequate IN-FOR for NN trend NN analysis STOP . IN-IN In NN addition COMMA , PRP it VBZ does NEG not VB correct IN-FOR for NN instrument NNS biases JJ that VBP have VBN occurred IN since NN launch STOP .
