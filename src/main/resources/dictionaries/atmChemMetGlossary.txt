Absorptance:: <B>GB</B> The ratio of absorbed to incident radiant or luminous flux.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Absorption coefficient:: Quantity used to specify the absorption of light at a given wavelength by a pure compound; it is the constant &#101; which appears in the Beer-Lambert law: lg(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>t</sub>) = [<i>A</i>]<i>l&#101; </i>, where <i>I</i><sub>o</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>t</sub> are the incident and transmitted monochromatic radiances (intensities), respectively for an optical path of length <i>l</i> and uniform concentration of absorbing compound [<i>A</i>] (commonly mol L<sup>-1</sup>, coherent SI units; mol m<sup>-3</sup>). The coefficient &#101; is sometimes called the (decadic) molar absorption coefficient. Although it is sometimes referred to as the extinction coefficient, this is not a good practice since extinction strictly implies the sum of absorption and scattering. There are several useful forms of this relation which are used in describing light absorption. When napierian (natural) logarithms are used, the symbol &#107; is recommended with the name napierian molar absorption coefficient or molar cross section. Pressure of a gas (STP) may be used rather than concentration, etc. See also <i>absorption cross section</i>. The specific form of the law employed (base of the logarithms. concentration, and pathlength units) must be stated with absorption coefficient data derived from it if the data are to be of use to the scientific community.

#Acid deposition:: The acids deposited by transfer from the atmosphere either by precipitation (rain, fog, snow, etc.), called <i>wet deposition</i>, or by direct transfer to the surface of the earth induced by the flow of acid-containing air masses over the earth's surface, called dry deposition. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
#Acid rain:: Rain with pH values &lt; about 5; commonly results from acids formed from pollutants. "Pure" rain water equilibrated with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and naturally occurring acids in relatively clean air usually has a pH &gt; 5.<i>Actinic flux</i> (<i>S&#108;</i>): The quantity of light available to molecules at a particular point in the atmosphere and which, on absorption, drives photochemical processes in the atmosphere. It is calculated by integrating the spectral radiance <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;) over all directions of incidence of the light, ยบ&#113;ยบ&#102; &#123;<i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;)/(<i>hc</i>/&#108;))&#125; sin&#113; d&#113;<i> </i>d&#102;<i>.</i> If the radiance is expressed in J m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> st<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup> and <i>hc</i>/&#108; is the energy per quantum of light of wavelength &#108;, the actinic flux has units of quanta cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>. This important quantity is one of the terms required in the calculation of <i>j</i>-values, the first order rate coefficients for photochemical processes in the sunlight-absorbing, trace gases in the atmosphere. The actinic flux is determined by the solar radiation entering the atmosphere and by any changes in this due to atmospheric gases and particles (e.g., Rayleigh scattering, absorption by stratospheric ozone, scattering and absorption by aerosols and clouds), and reflections from the ground. It is therefore dependent on the wavelength of the light, on the altitude, and on specific local environmental conditions. The actinic flux has borne many names (e.g., flux, flux density, beam irradiance, actinic irradiance, integrated intensity) which has caused some confusion. It is important to distinguish the actinic flux from the spectral irradiance, which refers to energy arrival on a flat surface having fixed spatial orientation (J m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>) given by <i>E</i>(&#108;) = ยบ&#113;ยบ&#102; <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;) cos&#113;<i> </i> sin&#113;<i> </i>d&#102; d&#102; . The actinic flux does not refer to any specific orientation because molecules are oriented randomly in the atmosphere. This distinction is of practical relevance: the actinic flux (and therefore a <i>j</i>-value) near a brightly reflecting surface (e.g., over snow, or above a thick cloud) can be a factor of three higher than that near a non-reflecting surface. The more descriptive name of <i>spectral</i> <i>spheradiance</i> is suggested for the quantity herein called actinic flux. See also <i>flux density, photon</i>. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
#Acid:: A species which reacts in liquid water to generate hydrogen ions (conventionally represented as cations H<sup>+</sup> or hydronium, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>); anions (e.g., sulphate, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>; nitrate, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) which were associated with the H<sup>+</sup> in the acid are also released. Important acids in the atmosphere include sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), and organic acids (e.g., formic acid, HCO<sub>2</sub>H; acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, etc.). <B>GB</B>: <i>Br&oslash;nsted acid</i>: A molecular entity capable of donating a proton to a base, (i.e. a "proton donor") or the corresponding chemical species.

For example: Me<sub>3</sub>B + :NH<sub>3</sub> --&gt; Me<sub>3</sub>B<sup><sup>-</sup></sup> - <sup><sup>+</sup></sup>NH<sub>3</sub>Lewis acid + Lewis base --&gt; Lewis adduct<B>GB</b>: <i>Hard acid</i>: A Lewis acid with an acceptor centre of low polarizability. It preferentially associates with hard bases rather than with soft bases, in a qualitative sense. For example, the hard O- (or N-) bases are preferred to their S- (or P-) analogues. Conversely a soft acid possesses an acceptor centre of high polarizability and exhibits the reverse preference of a partner for co-ordination. These preferences are not defined in a quantitative sense. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Activity coefficient:: The coefficient (&#103;) measures the degree of departure of a component in solution from ideal behavior. It relates concentration &#91;<i>A</i>] and activity (<i>a</i>) for a substance in solution: <i>a</i> = &#103;[<i>A</i>]. The concentrations and activities of components are often given in molal units (mol kg<sup>-1</sup> of solute). The activity coefficient, &#103;, is usually determined empirically; it depends not only upon the concentration of the substance but on its particular properties and on the concentration and kind of other substances present. As the concentration of the solute approaches zero, the activity coefficient approaches unity. <B>GB</B>: The activity coefficient &#103;<sub>B</sub> of a single substance B in a solution (especially in a dilute liquid solution) containing molalities <i>m</i><sub>B</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>C</sub>,..., of solute substances B, C,..., in a solvent substance A, is a number defined in terms of the absolute activity &#103;<sub>B</sub> of the solute substance B in the solution by<i>&#103;</i><sub>B</sub> = (&#108;<sub>B</sub>/<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)/(&#108;<sub>B</sub>/<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)&#165; (<i>T</i>, <i>p</i> constant)or in terms of the chemical potential &#109;<sub>B</sub> by<i>RT</i>ln(<i>m</i><sub>B&#103;B</sub>) = &#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; (&#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; <i>RT</i>ln<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)&#165; (<i>T</i>, <i>p</i> constant)where the superscript &#165; denotes infinite dilution.

An aerosol may be characterized by its chemical composition, its radioactivity, the particle size distribution, the electrical charge and the optical properties. <B>GB</B>: Aerosols are dispersions in gases. In aerosols the particles often exceed the usual size limits for colloids. If the dispersed particles are solid, one speaks of aerosols of solid particles, if they are liquid of "aerosols of liquid particles".

Albedo:: The fraction of the energy of electromagnetic radiation reflected from a body (or surface) relative to the energy incident upon it. The reflection of light from a surface is, of course, dependent on the wavelength of the light, the nature of the surface, and its angle of incidence with the surface.

Aldehyde:: A class of organic compound of general formula: R(C=O)H, where R is an hydrogen atom or hydrocarbyl group (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc.). These are products of hydrocarbon oxidation. The simplest aldehydes are formaldehyde (methanal, CH<sub>2</sub>O), acetaldehyde (ethanal, CH<sub>3</sub>CHO), and propionaldehyde (propanal, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO). Aldehydes absorb sunlight (&#108; &lt; 330 nm) and generate radicals. They also react rapidly with HO-radicals in the atmosphere to produce acyl (RCO) and acylperoxyl (RCOO<sub>2</sub>) radicals. Formaldehyde is the most abundant aldehyde in the atmosphere (formed from the natural hydrocarbon, CH<sub>4</sub>, as well as other hydrocarbons) where its mixing ratios are often &gt; 0.2 ppbv even in relatively clean air. Acetaldehyde is a major precursor to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) in the troposphere.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

Ames/salmonella test:: A screening test employed in predicting the mutagenic and the potential carcinogenic activities of chemicals in the environment. It employs Ames test strains of salmonella bacteria (<i>his</i><sup>-</sup>) which lack the ability to produce histidine. The compound to be tested, the bacteria and a small amount of histidine (insufficient to permit colony growth but enough to allow sufficient growth for expression of mutations) are added to agar. The bacteria are allowed to incubate for about 63 hours at 37 &#176;C. If a significant increase in colonies above background is observed in the sample containing the test compound, then it is concluded that the chemical tested is a direct mutagen for the particular Ames strain of bacteria. This is taken as a qualitative indication of the <i>possible</i> carcinogenic activity of this chemical in other biological systems. This procedure seems to be of qualitative value in a preliminary screening of potential carcinogens.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

Chain reaction:: Chain reactions are characterized by a series of interrelated steps involving initiation, propagation, and termination. If the propagation steps recur a number of times for each initiation step and termination step, the reaction is called a chain reaction. For example, in the Cl<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub> system which is irradiated within the Cl<sub>2</sub> absorption band, the reaction is initiated by the photodissociation of Cl<sub>2</sub>: Cl<sub>2</sub> + h&#110; --&gt; 2Cl. The propagation steps involve the reaction and reformation of Cl atoms: Cl + H<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HCl + H; H + Cl<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HCl + Cl; eventually termination occurs largely through the reassociation of Cl atoms: 2Cl + M --&gt; Cl<sub>2</sub> + M. M is a third body which removes some of energy released by the formation of C1, and allows it to be stabilized. The C1,-H, system can have a chain length of up to a million at low light intensities; i.e., 106 molecules of HCIcan form for each Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule photodissociated. In the atmosphere the oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> which occurs in the sunlight-irradiated mixture of NO<sub>x</sub> and hydrocarbons, a complex series of chain reactions occur involving HO-, HO<sub>2</sub>-, and RO<sub>2</sub>-radicals, NO, hydrocarbons, and their oxidation products. <B>GB</B>: In chain polymerization reactions, reactive intermediates of the same type, generated in successive steps or cycles of steps, differ in molecular mass, as inRCH<sub>2</sub>CHPh + H<sub>2</sub>C=CHPh --&gt; RCH<sub>2</sub>CHPhCH<sub>2</sub>CHPhSource = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

Coefficient of haze:: One technique of measurement of the amount of filterable particulate matter suspended in air which has been used in the past depends upon drawing a measured sample of air (usually 1000 linear feet) through a paper or membrane filter. A measurement is made of the intensity of light transmitted through the dust spot formed relative to that transmitted through an identical clean filter. The dirtiness of the air is reported in terms of the COH unit. This relates to the quantity of particulate material which produces an optical density, lg(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i>) of 0.01 when measured by light transmission at 400 nm and relative to the transmission of an identical dust-free filter taken as 100%. Thus a filter which transmitted 50% relative to the clean filter has an absorbance of 0.301 or 30.1 COH units. This is not a recommended measure of filterable particulate matter since the size, color and other properties of the aerosol and the air in which it is suspended affect the results.

Concentration, gas and liquid solutions:: This represents the quantity of matter (mol, g, molecules, or other) per unit of volume (cm<sup>3</sup>, L, m<sup>3</sup>, or other). The IUPAC <B>GB</B> designation of this quantity is the amount of substance concentration (with the SI base unit of mol m<sup>-1</sup>, but practical units of mol dm<sup>-3</sup> or mol L<sup>-1</sup>). For a gas phase species it is common to describe the concentration as the number of molecules of the particular species per cm<sup>3</sup> of air; this unit is most common in gas phase kinetics and in calculations involving chemical changes in the atmosphere. The number concentration or number density, often employed in physics and in physical chemistry, describes the number of molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>; however in writing the units for this quantity, molecules are understood but omitted; only cm is written. The most common method of describing concentration of a given solute in the liquid phase (such as cloud-water) is the amount of the compound or ion (in moles) present per litre of the solution. One mole of a given species is 6.02213 x 10<sup>23</sup> (Avogadro constant) of these species. The mixing ratio is also employed as a measure of relative concentration. For a non-reactive gas, the mixing ratio does not change with altitude although the absolute concentration (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>) decreases. Thus one part-per-million by volume (1 ppmv) is a concentration equivalent to one molecule of a given species present in one million molecules (10<sup>6</sup>) of air. Similarly one part-per-billion by volume (1 ppbv) represents a molecular ratio of one molecule for every 10<sup>9</sup> molecules of air; one part-per-trillion by volume (1 pptv) represents one molecule per 10<sup>12</sup> molecules of air. Concentrations of solids suspended in air are sometimes given in units of mass of the species per unit volume (e.g., micrograms per cubic meter of air). At times the mass fraction is used in contrast to the use of the volume, molecule, or mole fraction (e.g., ppmv); thus one part-per-million by mass (ppmm) is one unit of mass of a given species per million mass units of the mixture.

For atmospheric aerosols, this is a complex distribution for which diameters range from below 0.01 to above 100 &#109;m; the particles making the highest contribution to the total number density are in the size range below 0.1 &#109;m, those contributing most to the total surface area are in the 0.1 to 1.0 &#109;m range, while those with the highest contribution to the volume or mass of the aerosol come from both the 0.1 to 1.0 and 1.0 to 100 &#109;m ranges.

Condensation:: The physical process of converting a material from a gaseous or vapour phase to a liquid or solid phase; this commonly results when the temperature is lowered and/or the vapour pressure of the material is increased. The tendency exists for condensation to occur when the partial pressure of a given component of a gaseous mixture at a given temperature exceeds the vapour pressure of the liquid or solid form of that component at the given temperature.<i>Condensation nuclei</i> (sometimes symbolized as CN): A particle, either liquid or solid, or an ion upon which condensation of water vapour (or other substances) begins in the atmosphere. Condensation nuclei are usually very small hygroscopic aerosols (0.001 to 0.1 &#109;m in diameter), but these are not as abundant as the smaller particles. The number of CN which are active (initiate condensation) in a given air mass may be a function of the relative humidity. Usually CN are counted as the active nuclei at about 300% relative humidity, while cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are counted as the number of active nuclei at relative humidity less than or equal to 102%.<i>Constituent</i> (with reference to an air sample): A component of the air sample for which a specified quantity is to be determined by measurement or analysis; see <i>air quality characteristic</i>.

Flowmeter:: An instrument for measuring the rate of flow of a fluid moving through a tube, pipe or duct system. The instrument is calibrated to furnish volume or mass rate of flow. Several types of flowmeters are in use: <i>a) Variable area flowmeter: A flowmeter consisting of a tapered tube and a float. The gas enters at the bottom of the tube. The inner diameter of the tube increases from the bottom to the top, and the float is supported in the tube at a height which is a function of the rate of now and the nature of the gas in the tube; this is sometimes referred to as a rotameter which is derived from a trademark. <i>b) Soap film flowmeter</i>: A flowmeter in which a soap film is generated on a cross section' of a graduated tube (sometimes a calibrated buret is employed) in which the gas to be measured passes. The film moves along the tube at the same rate as the gas flow. The measured time required for the film to sweep through a measured volume can be used to calculate the gas flow rate. This is often employed in gas chromatography work. <i>c) Critical orifice flowmeter</i>: A device consisting of a plate having an orifice of small diameter and placed in a gas stream such that the total now passing through the orifice has a velocity at least equal to the sonic velocity. A pressure measuring device is attached upstream of the orifice. The now is proportional to the upstream pressure and independent from the downstream pressure. <i>d) Spirometer</i>: An absolute flow measuring device consisting of two cylinders each sealed at one end and having slightly different diameters. The smaller is inverted into the larger which is filled with a confining liquid. The inverted cylinder is suspended with counterweights so that it moves freely within the larger cylinder. Gas may either be displaced from the smaller cylinder or admitted to it. The dimensions of the smaller cylinder must be known. The rate of rise or fall of the inverted cylinder can be used to calculate the rate of flow of gas either into or out of the spirometer. The device is used principally for calibrating other devices. Other types of flow meters also are in wide use today (e.g., the Hastings-type mass flowmeter). Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

Free radical:: A reactive atom or a fragment of a stable molecule which contains an odd number of bonding electrons. These reactive species have very short lifetimes in the lower atmosphere and low concentrations, although they are responsible for much of the chemical transformations in the atmosphere. Typical radical species encountered in atmospheric chemistry are: HO, HO<sub>2</sub>, Cl, ClO, NO<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>O,, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. The concentrations show strong diurnal variations. NO and NO<sub>2</sub> are technically radicals as well (since they have an odd-number of bonding electrons), but they do not exhibit the high reactivity normally associated with typical radicals. Some chemists (from Great Britain and elsewhere) follow a practice of coupling with the formula of a radical, a dot placed near the atom in the radical which is judged to have the highest probability for the location of the odd electron. Thus the <i>n</i>-propyl and isopropyl radicals may be written as CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#183;</sup> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sup>&#183;</sup>, respectively. Although this practice is not followed today by many of the atmospheric scientists, its use has some value in that it allows a rapid recognition of a radical species and of its reactive site. <i>Biradicals</i> contain two unpaired electrons, e.g., O(<sup>3</sup>P), CH<sub>2</sub>(triplet), CH<sub>2</sub>OO (Criegee intermediate), O<sub>2</sub>(ground state) etc. <i>Radical ions</i> are charged radicals (most common in solution phase reactions). <B>GB</B>: At least in the context of physical organic chemistry, it seems desirable to cease using the adjective "free" in the general name of this type of <i>chemical species</i> and molecular entity, so that the term free radical may in future be restricted to those radicals which do not form parts of <i>radical pairs</i>.

Lifted Index (or LI):: A common measure of atmospheric instability. Its value is obtained by computing the temperature that air near the ground would have if it were lifted to some higher level (around 18,000 feet, usually) and comparing that temperature to the actual temperature at that level. Negative values indicate instability;the more negative, the more unstable the air is, and if thunderstorms develop they are more likely to be stronger. Source = NOAA Met Glossary.

Luminance:: Photometric counterpart of radiance, producing the visual sensation called brightness. Typical units are: candela m<sup>-2</sup> (nit), candela cm<sup>-2</sup> (stilb), foot lambert (2.426 nit). As with all photometric quantities, luminance does not refer to a specific wavelength, but applies to light emitted by a standard source (formerly a "standard international candle", now a blackbody radiator emitting at the temperature of solidifying platinum, 2042 K). Conversion from photometric units to radiometric units (e.g., J s<sup>-1</sup>) requires convolution over wavelength of the relative spectral response of the human eye (photopic response tables).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Luminescence:: The emission of light by a molecule or ion which is at temperatures below those required for incandescence. Luminescence can originate from electronically excited states of molecules or ions. If the excited state is short lived, as is the case for excited singlet to ground state singlet electronic transitions, the emission follows excitation within a short time period (about 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup> s commonly) and is called <i>fluorescence</i>. The fluorescence from the polycyclic aromatic compounds provides a useful means of identification and quantification of these species. If the emitting state undergoes a spectroscopically forbidden transition, for example, an excited triplet to ground state singlet electronic transition, then the emission may be delayed (greater than about 10<sup>-3</sup> s) following excitation; this emission is called <i>phosphorescence</i>. Some molecules (e.g., butanedione) give strong phosphorescence which is useful in identification. <i>Chemiluminescenc</i>e is the emission which results from an excited state formed in a chemical reaction which does not involve light absorption; for example, luminol oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generates chemiluminescence which can be used for analytical purposes.

#OH:: The hydroxyl radical. A reactive radical which is a very important intermediate in the chemistry of the atmosphere.

The HO-radical reacts readily with most hydrocarbons (RH) to generate alkylperoxyl or arylperoxyl radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>), HO + RH --&gt; R + H<sub>2</sub>O; R + O<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RO<sub>2</sub>; aldehydes (RCHO) react to form acylperoxy radicals, RCHO + HO --&gt; RCO + H<sub>2</sub>O; RCO + O<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RCOO<sub>2</sub>.

pH:: A measure of the acidity of aqueous solutions. As originally defined by S&oslash;renson in 1909, the quantity pH = -lg[H<sup>+</sup>]. However since activities of hydrogen ion (and not hydrogen ion concentrations) are measured by means of pH meters which employ an electrochemical cell (often a glass electrode), it is logical to define pH in terms of the activity of hydrogen ion (<i>a</i><sub>H+</sub>) in solution:pH = -lg(<i>a</i><sub>H+</sub>)The pH of pure water (25 &#176;C) = 7.0; acid solutions have values of pH &lt; 7 while basic solutions have pH &gt; 7. <B>GB</B>: The concept of pH is unique amongst physicochemical quantities in that, in terms of its (notational) definition given in the above equation, involving as it does a single ion activity, it is immeasurable. It is therefore defined operationally in terms of the operation or method used to measure it, see http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04524.html or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH.

Phase:: In chemistry, a physically distinct, homogeneous portion of a heterogeneous mixture. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photochemical reaction:: A reaction involving an electronically excited state of a molecule or atom which can occur following light absorption of sufficient energy per quantum (usually ultraviolet or visible radiation). In electronically excited molecules one of several types of photochemical reaction may occur: photodecomposition into molecular fragments or radicals, photodecomposition into stable, smaller products, photoisomerization, intersystem crossing (a singlet to triplet state, etc.), internal energy conversion (e.g., excited singlet to vibrationally excited, singlet ground state), fluorescence, phosphorescence, electronic or vibrational energy quenching, etc. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photochemical smog:: The resulting mix of ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, aldehydes and other oxidation products of the hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, aerosols, etc., which form in highly polluted urban atmospheres under conditions of stagnation and high sunlight intensity in cities such as Los Angeles, California. Most large cities in the world show some degree of photochemical smog generation today. Photochemical smog is a highly oxidizing atmosphere in contrast with the SO<sub>2</sub>-rich pollution and fogs which characterized many cities such as London, England, many years ago. The characteristics of photochemical smog also include eye-irritation, visibility reduction, damage to certain sensitive plants and trees, and possible pulmonary and other health-related problems in humans and animals. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photochemistry:: The chemistry of excited electronic states of atoms and molecules formed by the absorption of light by an atom or molecule. The primary processes in photochemistry of a given compound are the various reaction channels of the electronically excited species. These can be molecular decomposition into stable molecules or radicals, molecular isomerization, fluorescence, phosphorescence, electronic quenching by collision, etc. The reactions of the molecular fragments which are formed photochemically, are correctly referred to as thermal reactions, in that they are analogous to the reactions induced following thermal decomposition at high temperatures. The term photochemistry is sometimes used incorrectly by atmospheric scientists to refer both the photochemical reactions of the electronically excited species as well as the purely thermal reactions of the atoms, free radicals and molecules which are present in the atmosphere. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photolysis:: Although it means literally the cleavage of a bond by light, it has been used incorrectly to indicate the act of irradiating a substance with light. Specific terms such as <i>photodecomposition</i>, <i>photoisomerization</i>, <i>photodissaciation</i>, which describe the physical consequences of the irradiation are more descriptive and are recommended terms. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photometry:: The measurement of light over wavelengths which produce visual sensation (approximately 380-780 nm). Thus photometric quantities do not refer to a specific wavelength but to the light emitted by a standard source (formerly a standard international candle, now a blackbody radiator emitting at the temperature of solidifying platinum, 2042 K). <i>Luminance</i> and <i>illuminance</i> are the photometric analogues of the radiometric quantities <i>radiance</i> and <i>irradiance</i>, respectively, but conversion from photometric units (e.g., lm cm<sup>-2</sup>) to radiometric units (e.g., J s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) requires convolution over wavelength of the spectral radiation with the relative spectral response of the human eye. The standard response is called the "spectral luminous efficiency of radiation", and is tabulated for daylight adapted vision in photopic response tables. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photophoresis:: in aerosol physics, the motion of particles due to the influence of light. In many cases, this amounts to a special form of thermophoresis due to the heating of the particles by the light. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Photostationary state:: Highly reactive species in the atmosphere are often destroyed at a rate which is approximately equal to that at which they are formed. If the process of formation or destruction of such a species is initiated by light, then the reactive species is said to be in a photo-stationary state. The concentration of such species adjusts to changes in the actinic flux (time of day, cloud-cover, etc.) and other reactant concentrations. The system of ozone, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide in the sunlight-irradiated troposphere achieves a photostationary state when NO is the major reactant to destroy ozone; for these conditions the reactions are: NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; O(<sup>3</sup>P) + NO (1); O(<sup>3</sup>P) + O<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M (2); O<sub>3</sub> + NO --&gt; NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> (3). At the photostationary state the concentration of ozone is given by: [O<sub>3</sub>] ร ([NO<sub>2</sub>]/[NO](<i>j</i><sub>NO2</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>3</sub>), where <i>j</i><sub>NO2</sub> is the effective first order rate coefficient for reaction (1) for the given conditions of actinic flux and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> is the second order rate coefficient for reaction (3) at the appropriate temperature of the atmosphere. Deviations from the O<sub>3</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> photo-stationary state are expected in theory and are observed in the atmosphere when reaction (3) does not dominate the O<sub>3</sub> loss mechanisms, e.g., at low [NO].

Photosynthesis:: A metobolic process involving plants and some types of bacteria (e.g., Chromataceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Chlorobiaceae) in which light energy absorbed by chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments results in the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> followed by the formation of organic compounds. In plants the overall process involves the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O to carbohydrates (and other plant material) and the release of O<sub>2</sub>.

The body of the gauge is at atmospheric or some other controlled pressure. Increasing pressure within the gauge causes the radius of curvature to increase, and this motion drives an indicator. <i>b) Capacitance gauge</i>: A device in which a metal coated diaphragm serves as one plate of a capacitor. A reference pressure is applied to one side of the diaphragm and the pressure to be measured is applied to the other. Changes in pressure, change the capacitance which is transformed to a pressure reading by the device.

Quality assurance:: The guarantee that the quality of a product (analytical data set, etc.) is actually what is claimed on the basis of the quality control applied in creating that product. Quality assurance is not synonymous with quality control. Quality assurance is meant to protect against failures of quality control. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Quality control:: The maintenance and statement of the quality of a product (data set, etc.) specifically that it meets or exceeds some minimum standard based on known, testable criteria. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Quantum of light:: A photon or "particle" of light; this has an energy given by <i>E</i> = <i>hc/&#108;</i> where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant, <i>c</i> the velocity of light, and &#108; the wavelength of light. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Quantum yield:: a) For primary processes this is the fraction of electronically excited molecules which decompose, isomerize, fluoresce, or react by some other specific pathway. If the excited molecule of <i>X</i> decomposes by reaction (I), <i>X</i> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> (I), then the quantum yield of this process is symbolized by &#102;<sub>I</sub>. If there are n different primary processes in which the excited state is involved, then the sum of the different process is equl to 1. b) For secondary products formed in the thermal reactions which follow the primary photochemical steps, the quantum yield of any stable product (<i>C</i>) is defined as the number of molecules of <i>C</i> formed in the system during a given short time period divided by the number of light quanta absorbed by <i>X</i> in the system during this time period. This quantum yield may be any number. It is often symbolized using a capital phi (e.g., &#70;<sub>C</sub>) to distinguish it from the primary quantum yield; thus the quantum yield of hydrogen chloride (&#70;<sub>HCl</sub>) can be as high as 10<sup>6</sup> in irradiated mixtures of Cl<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> where chain reactions are important; see chain reaction. <B>GB</B>: The number of moles transformed in a specified process, physically (e.g., by emission of photons) or chemically, per mole of photons absorbed by the system.

Radar:: An instrument used to detect precipitation by measuring the strength of the electromagnetic signal reflected back. (RADAR= Radio Detection and Ranging). Source = NOAA Met Glossary.
Radiance:: The radiance, <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;<i>,&#102;</i>) is defined as <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;<i>,&#102;</i>) = d<i>Q</i>/(cos&#113; d<i>s</i> d&#119; d<i>t</i> d&#108;), where d<i>Q</i> is the radiant (light) energy in the wavelength interval &#108; to &#108; + d&#108; which is transported across a particular surface element of area d<i>s</i>, in time d<i>t</i>, originating from a solid angle d&#119; which is at an angle &#113; to the surface normal. Thus, the radiance specifies the energy emanating from an extended source, measured per unit time, unit solid angle, unit wavelength, and unit area of a surface perpendicular to the direction of incidence. In contrast to the actinic flux and the irradiance, the radiance has complete information about the direction of incidence of the light. The adjective "spectral" is often used with "radiance" to emphasize its wavelength dependence. The term "intensity" is often used instead of "radiance". Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Radiant excitance:: The derivative of the incident radiant power with respect to the projected area of a specified emitting surface (W cm<sup>-2</sup>) With the adjective spectral, differentiation with respect to wavelength is also implied (W cm<sup>-2</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>). Irradiance and excitance are similar but refer to energy <i>arriving at</i> versus <i>leaving from</i> a surface, respectively.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Radiant intensity:: Radiant power per unit solid angle (W sr<sup>-1</sup>). With the adjective <i>spectral</i>, differentiation with respect to wavelength is also implied (W sr<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>). Unfortunately, several other conflicting definitions of intensity exist, including the power per unit area, and the power per unit solid angle and projected area. The latter definition is common in atmospheric radiative transfer literature, and is synonymous with <i>radiance</i>. In spectroscopic literature and in Beer-Lambert law studies, the term <i>intensity</i> is used to describe the radiant power of collimated light entering a detector; this definition is synonymous with <i>irradiance</i>. These ambiguous uses of intensity are so common as to be unavoidable, but unless the definition given above is intended, it is best to use the word only in a generic sense to signify the amount of light, and then to use the appropriate radiative quantity for numerical calculations. <B>GB</B>: The energy per unit time entering a small sphere in a time interval divided by the area of the great circle of the sphere and the time interval. For monodirectional radiation, this reduces to the energy flux density.<i>Interferant</i> (<B>GB</B>: <i>interferent</i>): In measuring the concentration of a constituent of an air sample; any other component that affects the instrument reading. <B>GB</B>: A concomitant causing an interference in a sample.

Radiation Fog:: Fog produced over the land by the cooling of the lower atmosphere as it comes in contact with the ground. Also known as ground fog. Source = NOAA Met Glossary.
Radiation:: Energy emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves. Radiation has differing characteristics depending upon the wavelength. Radiation from the Sun has a short wavelength (ultra-violet) while energy re-radiated from the Earth's surface and the atmosphere has a long wavelength (infra-red). Source = NOAA Met Glossary.
Radiational Cooling:: Cooling process of the Earth's surface and adjacent air, which occurs when infrared (heat) energy radiates from the surface of the Earth upward through the atmosphere into space. Air near the surface transfers its thermal energy to the nearby ground through conduction, so that radiative cooling lowers the temperature of both the surface and the lowest part of the atmosphere. Source = NOAA Met Glossary.
#Radical:: A reactive atom or a fragment of a stable molecule which contains an odd number of bonding electrons. These reactive species have very short lifetimes in the lower atmosphere and low concentrations, although they are responsible for much of the chemical transformations in the atmosphere. Typical radical species encountered in atmospheric chemistry are: HO, HO<sub>2</sub>, Cl, ClO, NO<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>O,, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. The concentrations show strong diurnal variations. NO and NO<sub>2</sub> are technically radicals as well (since they have an odd-number of bonding electrons), but they do not exhibit the high reactivity normally associated with typical radicals. Some chemists (from Great Britain and elsewhere) follow a practice of coupling with the formula of a radical, a dot placed near the atom in the radical which is judged to have the highest probability for the location of the odd electron. Thus the <i>n</i>-propyl and isopropyl radicals may be written as CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#183;</sup> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sup>&#183;</sup>, respectively. Although this practice is not followed today by many of the atmospheric scientists, its use has some value in that it allows a rapid recognition of a radical species and of its reactive site. <i>Biradicals</i> contain two unpaired electrons, e.g., O(<sup>3</sup>P), CH<sub>2</sub>(triplet), CH<sub>2</sub>OO (Criegee intermediate), O<sub>2</sub>(ground state) etc. <i>Radical ions</i> are charged radicals (most common in solution phase reactions). <B>GB</B>: At least in the context of physical organic chemistry, it seems desirable to cease using the adjective free in the general name of this type of <i>chemical species</i> and molecular entity, so that the term free radical may in future be restricted to those radicals which do not form parts of <i>radical pairs</i>. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
#radical ions::<i>Radical ions</i> are charged radicals (most common in solution phase reactions). Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Radiometry:: The measurement of quantities associated with radiant energy. The quantities may also describe the variation of the energy with respect to other variables such as wavelength, time, position, direction (solid angle), area normal to the light, or projected area of emitting or receiving surfaces. For example, see <i>intensity: radiance, irradiance</i>. If the light is monochromatic, it is sometimes convenient to replace the radiant energy by the corresponding number of photons (or quanta) which is obtained by dividing the energy by <i>hc/&#108;</i> where it is the Planck constant, <i>c</i> the velocity of light, and &#108; the wavelength of the light. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

Rain out:: The mechanism by which small particles in the clouds are removed by the formation of rain-drops; this is a different mechanism from <i>wash out</i> which is a process which occurs below cloud level. Both the terms rain out and <i>wash out</i> have not always been used in accordance with these definitions. For clarity they should be replaced by the term, <i>in-cloud scavenging</i> and <i>below-cloud scavenging</i>, respectively. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Rain-Free Base:: A horizontal, dark cumulonimbus base that has no visible precipitation beneath it. This structure usually marks the location of the thunderstorm updraft. Tornadoes most commonly develop (1) from wall clouds that are attached to the rain-free base, or (2) from the rain-free base itself. This is particularly true when the rain-free base is observed to the south or southwest of the precipitation shaft. Source = NOAA Met Glossary.

Rankine Temperature Scale:: A temperature scale with the degree of the Fahrenheit temperature scale and the zero point of the Kelvin temperature scale. Source = NOAA Met Glossary.
Rate coefficient:: A coefficient (sometimes referred to as a <i>rate constant</i>) that appears in a rate equation which relates the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentrations of reactants: first order rate coefficient, <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> in the relation, -d[A]/d<i>t</i> = [A]<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, where [A] is the concentration of species A. Second order rate coefficient, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> in the relation, -d[A]/d<i>t</i> = [A][B]<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>. Third order rate coefficient, <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> in the relation, -d[A]/d<i>t</i> = [A][B][C]<i>k</i><sub>3</sub>; A, B, and C represent reactant molecules, and A, B, and C may be the same or different molecules. Many reactions which involve the association of two radicals (e.g., HO + NO<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; HONO<sub>2</sub> + M) have second order rate coefficients which are pressure dependent and show a transition between third order at low pressures (direct dependence on [M]) to second order (independent of [M]) at high pressures. <i>Troe</i> expressions are often used to describe these. Some complex or composite reactions (e.g., chain reactions, heterogeneous reactions, solution phase reactions, etc.) have rate equations of a more complex form (fractional powers on the concentrations, ratios of concentrations, etc.). The term <i>rate coefficient</i> rather than <i>rate constant</i> is preferred since the k values are commonly dependent on temperature, total pressure, etc. Also in a composite reaction the measured rate coefficient may depend on a concentration term. Rate coefficients for photodissociation (called <i>j-values</i>) apply to photochemical reactions such as NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; O(<sup>3</sup>P) + NO; see <i>j-value</i>.

An acceptable mechanism of a specified reaction (and there may be a number of such alternative mechanisms not excluded by the evidence) must be consistent with the reaction stoichiometry, the rate law, and all other available experimental data, such as the stereochemical course of the reaction. Inferences concerning the electronic and nuclear motions which dynamically interconvert successive species along the reaction path, are often included in the description of a mechanism.

An atom in a molecule or an ion which has a low <i>oxidation state</i>. An element or atom in a compound can be reduced by the reaction of an element or compound with hydrogen, while it can be oxidized by reaction with oxygen. A reduced species can be formed also through the gain of electrons (either at the negative electrode in a ceil or through transfer from another atom, ion, or group of atoms in a chemical reaction). For example, the carbon atom in CH<sub>4</sub> and other hydrocarbons is in a reduced state, while the carbon in CO<sub>2</sub> is in an oxidized state. Similarly the sulfur atom in H<sub>2</sub>S is in a reduced state while that in sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is in an oxidized state. See <i>oxidation state</i>.

In the absence of other indication, the probability is 95%. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Residence time:: <i>b) Atmospheric</i>: The average time a molecule or aerosol spends in the atmosphere after it is released or generated there.

Smog chamber:: A large confined volume in which sunlight or simulated sunlight is allowed to irradiate air mixtures of atmospheric trace gases (hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, etc.) which undergo oxidation. In theory these chambers allow the controlled study of complex reactions which occur in the atmosphere. However, ill-defined wall reactions which generate some molecular and radical species (e.g., HONO, CH<sub>2</sub>O, HO-radicals, etc.) and remove certain products (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, etc.), the use of reactant concentrations well above those in the atmosphere, ill-defined light intensities and wavelength distribution within the chamber, and other factors peculiar to chamber experiments require that caution be exercised in the extrapolation of results obtained from them to atmospheric systems.

Smog:: The term originated in Great Britain as a popular derivation of "smoke-fog" and appears to have been in common use before World War I. It originally referred to the heavy pollution derived largely from coal burning (largely smoke filled air, rich in sulfur dioxide), and it probably was largely a reducing atmosphere. More common today in cities is an oxidising atmosphere which contains ozone and other oxidants; see <i>photochemical smog</i>.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

Near sea level only light of wavelengths longer than about 290 nm is present.

The solubility of gases in water is often considered in terms of Henry's law. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Solution:: A homogeneous mixture of two or more elements or compounds.

Spectral Excitance:: The derivative of the incident radiant power with respect to the projected area of a specified emitting surface (W cm<sup>-2</sup>) With the adjective spectral, differentiation with respect to wavelength is also implied (W cm<sup>-2</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>). Irradiance and excitance are similar but refer to energy <i>arriving at</i> versus <i>leaving from</i> a surface, respectively.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Spectral intensity:: Radiant power per unit solid angle (W sr<sup>-1</sup>). With the adjective <i>spectral</i>, differentiation with respect to wavelength is also implied (W sr<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>). Unfortunately, several other conflicting definitions of intensity exist, including the power per unit area, and the power per unit solid angle and projected area. The latter definition is common in atmospheric radiative transfer literature, and is synonymous with <i>radiance</i>. In spectroscopic literature and in Beer-Lambert law studies, the term <i>intensity</i> is used to describe the radiant power of collimated light entering a detector; this definition is synonymous with <i>irradiance</i>. These ambiguous uses of intensity are so common as to be unavoidable, but unless the definition given above is intended, it is best to use the word only in a generic sense to signify the amount of light, and then to use the appropriate radiative quantity for numerical calculations. <B>GB</B>: The energy per unit time entering a small sphere in a time interval divided by the area of the great circle of the sphere and the time interval.

Stack gas:: Gaseous waste products discharged to the atmosphere through a stack. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.
Stack height selection:: The degree of dispersion of the stack effluent increases with the height of the stack. The maximum ground level concentration of pollutants and the point from the stack at which this occurs are complex functions of the wind turbulence and other meteorological factors as well as stack height. There are physical and practical limitations which control the choice of stack height: cost, air traffic hazards, aesthetic considerations, aerodynamic factors, vibration, materials, etc. The tallest stack now in existence (1990) is that of the International Nickel Company of Canada (Sudbury, Ontario) which is 379.7 m tall, with a diameter of 35.5 m at the base and 15.8 m at the top. It weighs 3.901 x 10<sup>7</sup> kg. In recent years there has been less reliance on tall stacks for dispersing stack effluent and more concern for pollutant removal either before, during, or after combustion. This has been brought about through the realization that transport of certain pollutants such as SO<sub>2</sub> can occur over large distances and introduce problems such as acid deposition at receptor sites many hundreds of kilometers from the source.

Steady state:: A term used in reaction kinetics to describe the near constant (steady) concentration of reactive intermediate species in a reacting system when it is formed at a rate which is approximately equal to its rate of removal. In the atmosphere very reactive transient species such as O(<sup>1</sup>D) and HO have very short lifetimes and achieve a steady state in a very short time. Longer lived transient radicals (e.g., organylperoxyl radicals and NO<sub>3</sub>) and reactive molecules (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) achieve a steady state much more slowly (or never achieve one), since the rates of their formation and/or destruction may vary significantly during the lifetime of the species. The steady state concentration of a highly reactive species does adjust quickly to changes in the conditions such as the reactant concentrations, and, if the reactions forming or destroying the intermediate have a photochemical component, the actinic flux. In this case when the nearly constant concentration of the reactive transient is achieved, the system is said to be in a <i>photostationary state</i>. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

A temperature inversion may be produced, for example, by the movement of a warm air mass over a cool one. Intense surface inversions may form over the land during nights with clear skies and low winds due to the radiative loss of heat from the surface of the earth. The temperature increases as a function of height in this case. Poor mixing of the pollutants generally occurs below the inversion, since the normal convective process which drive the warmer and lighter air at ground level to higher altitudes is interrupted as the rising air parcels encounter the warmer air above. Temperature inversions near the surface are particularly effective in trapping ground level emissions. Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary.

The rate of temperature decrease with increase in altitude which is expected to occur in an unperturbed dry air mass is 9.8 x 10<sup>-3</sup> &#176;C m<sup>-1</sup>. This is called the <i>dry adiabatic lapse rate</i>. The lapse rate is taken as positive when temperature decreases with increasing height. For air saturated with H<sub>2</sub>O, the lapse rate is less because of the release of the latent heat of water as it condenses.

#Air, composition of pure:: The composition of air is variable with respect to several of its components (e.g., CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O) so "pure" air has no precise meaning; it is commonly considered to be air which is free of dust, aerosols, and reactive gaseous contaminants of anthropogenic origin. The composition of the major components in dry air is relatively constant (percent by volume given): nitrogen, 78.084; oxygen, 20.946; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide, 0.033; neon, 0.0018; helium, 0.000524; methane, 0.00016, krypton 0.000114; hydrogen 0.00005; nitrous oxide, 0.00003; xenon, 0.0000087.

#Calibration gas mixture, methods of preparation of:: <i>a) Gravimetric method: A method in which each component of a mixture is successively added :o a gas cylinder which is weighed first empty and then after each addition. The concentration of each component is expressed as a mass ratio or mole ratio. <i>b) Manometric method</i>: A method in which each component of a mixture is added successively to a gas cylinder previously emptied and where the pressure is measured after each addition. The mole ratio can only be calculated from the pressure data if the deviation from ideality of the particular system is known. <i>c) Static volumetric method</i>: A method in which a mixture is prepared by combining two or more gases, contained in two or more separate calibrated volumes, all at known temperatures and pressures. The volume ratio of a component in the resulting mixture may be calculated from the known ratios of the calibrated volumes. The calculated volume ratio may differ from the mole ratio if the mixture does not behave ideally. <i>d) Dynamic volumetric method</i>: A method in which two or more gas streams, flawing at known volume flow rates under specified conditions are combined into a single stream. The volume ratio of any component in the resulting mixture is calculated from the ratio of the volume flow rates. Deviations from ideality of the mixture must be known in order to calculate the mole ratio unless the flow rates are measured in mass flow per unit time for all gases; in this case the mass or mole ratio can be directly calculated. <i>e) Saturation method</i>: A method in which a stream of gas is passed over or through a substance capable of evaporation or sublimation held at a fixed temperature. At equilibrium the concentration of the substance in the stream of gas will be determined by the vapour pressure of the substance at the temperature given. <i>f) Permeation method</i>: A method in which a stream of gas is passed over a porous or permeable tube or vessel containing a volatile substance usually present as the liquid and saturated vapour phases. The permeation rate of the substance through the walls of the tube should be constant at any given temperature as long as sufficient liquid and its vapour remain in the tube. The concentration of the substance in the stream of gas is determined by the rate of flow of the gas stream and the permeation rate of the substance. If the gas flow is measured in terms of mass per unit time and the permeation rate is known in the same units, then the mass ratio or the mole ratio can be calculated. <i>g)</i> <i>Diffusion method</i>: A method in which a gas or vapour diffuses through a restriction into a stream of gas flowing at constant rate. If the temperature and pressure of the diffusing species remain constant at the inlet to and within the restriction, the mass rate of now of the diffusing species will remain constant. <i>h)</i> <i>Comparison method</i>: A method in which the concentration of a component in a mixture is measured by comparison with another mixture or other mixtures containing the same component at known concentrations.

This is a strong acid and one of the two major acidic components of acid deposition; H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the other.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary. :: # chem tagger
#Nitric oxide (NO):: The major oxide of nitrogen emitted from combustion sources such as power plants, the exhaust of mobile sources, incinerators, etc. It is an important source of NO<sub>2</sub> through its oxidation by hydroperoxyl (HO<sub>2</sub>) and alkylperoxyl, acylperoxyl, and arylperoxyl radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone in the atmosphere.

#Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>3</sub>):: A common impurity in polluted atmospheres which arises from the oxidation of NO released from combustion sources. Its photodecomposition in sunlight of wavelengths less than 420 nm is an important step in the formation of ozone in the polluted troposphere: NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; NO + O; O + O<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M. It is also a major source of nitric acid in the troposphere through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical (HO): HO + NO<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; HNO<sub>3</sub> + M.

#Nitrogen pentoxide (dinitrogen pentoxide, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>):: An oxide of nitrogen which forms in the atmosphere through the oxidation of NO<sub>2</sub> by O<sub>3</sub>: NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; NO<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>; NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Its formation is favored in polluted air masses of high O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> content and during the night. It is a precursor to nitric acid through its reaction with water (liquid) or aqueous aerosols.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary. :: # chem tagger
#Nitrogen trioxide (NO<sub>3</sub>):: A transient species formed in the atmosphere by reaction of NO<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>3</sub> (NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; NO<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>). It is normally in equilibrium (or more likely approaching equilibrium) with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> through the reactions, NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> <img src=Image10.gif width=11 height=19> N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. NO<sub>3</sub> absorbs sunlight strongly and is photodissociated rapidly during the day. Its concentration rises at sundown, and it is most readily detected in the atmosphere at night through its strong absorption bands in the 620-660 nm region.

#Nitrous acid (HONO):: A weak acid formed in the troposphere. During the day HONO is formed by the reaction, HO + NO --&gt; HONO, but it is rapidly photodecomposed in sunlight (HONO + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; HO + NO) so that only a very small concentration of HONO is present at that time. In urban communities, a buildup of HONO occurs during the night from unknown sources. Possible sources include homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions such as: HO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HONO + O<sub>2</sub>; or 2NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O --&gt; HONO + HNO<sub>3</sub>.Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary. :: # chem tagger
#Oxygen, molecular (O<sub>2</sub>):: A reactive species which comprises about 21% by volume of the gases present in the earth's atmosphere. It is a necessary species for the existence of most forms of life on earth. It is a highly reactive gas which is capable of combining with most of the other elements. See also <i>ozone, O-atoms</i>.

#Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>):: A highly reactive compound which occurs in the atmosphere. It is formed in the stratosphere through the photolysis of molecular oxygen at wavelengths less than 240 nm: (O<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; 2O; O + O<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M). The stratospheric ozone acts as a protective shield which filters the wavelengths of sunlight which enter the lower atmosphere to those longer than about 290 nm. Ozone is a common secondary pollutant which is formed in a polluted air mass through the action of sunlight on NO<sub>2</sub> (NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; O + NO; O + O<sub>2</sub> + M(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M). This is the most abundant of the oxidants formed in photochemical smog.	Source = Calvert Atmos Chem Glossary. :: # chem tagger
#Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>):: A major oxidation product of sulfur-containing compounds in fuels and the major sulfur species emitted from power plants, furnaces, and other combustion sources. It is oxidized eventually to sulfuric acid and its salts in the atmosphere by reaction with HO-radicals in the gas phase, and more rapidly in cloud-water, rain, and in ground water, where it exists largely as HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ion, by reaction with dissolved H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and other oxidizing agents.
