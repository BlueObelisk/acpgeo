#Glossary of atmospheric chemistry terms (Recommendations 1990)	 	#
#Synopsis	 Over 620 atmospheric chemistry terms which are in common use by the international research community in the atmospheric sciences are defined. The diversified nature of the scientists involved in research in atmospheric chemistry (chemists, meteorologists, physicists, biologists, engineers, and others) requires that special attention be paid to the consistency of the terminology employed. Where alternative terms are in common use to describe a given process, piece of equipment, feature, or quantity used in atmospheric chemistry, recommended choices of the IUPAC Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry are given; these are consistent with the other IUPAC publications and recommendations on nomenclature. The range of terms includes composition of the atmosphere, clouds, solar radiation, chemical and physical changes in atmospheric components, instrumentation employed in analysis of the atmospheric components and in air quality control, and in effects of certain trace gases on materials, plants, and animals.	#
#INTRODUCTION	 The present document was prepared as part of a project of the IUPAC Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry. It was the judgment of this Commission that the unambiguous definition of terms and units employed by the international research community in atmospheric chemistry is essential to the achievement of reliable communications between ail parties. The diversified nature of the scientists involved in research in atmospheric chemistry, chemists, meteorologists, physicists, biologists, engineers, and others, points to the very special need for a definition of the common terms employed by each specialist with recommendations where alternative terms or units are in use today. In addition to the definition of terms, some examples are given in many cases to illustrate the use of the specific term in atmospheric chemistry. It is hoped that the reader will be tolerant of the inclusion in this Glossary of some terms which are obvious to the specialist in the area of their use, but are unclear to many others who work actively in other areas associated with atmospheric chemistry. In order to enhance the convenience of this Glossary to the user and in view of the specialized nature of many of the atmospheric chemistry terms, we have repeated here the definitions of many terms which appear in other IUPAC publications, rather than including only a reference to the IUPAC publication. All terms taken from the IUPAC <i>Compendium of Chemical Terminology</i>, Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1987, commonly referred to as the Gold Book, are preceded by the designation <B>GB</B> (Gold Book) in this Glossary. In cases where the definition given here is different from that given by some other IUPAC publication, we have taken care to ensure the compatibility of the definitions while including portions of the definition which are peculiar to atmospheric chemistry.It is the hope of this Commission that the Glossary will serve the Atmospheric Chemistry research community and lead to a more precise and uniform choice of common terms in the communication between atmospheric scientists around the world. In the preparation of this document, the members of the Commission relied not only on their own experience and knowledge, but we are grateful to our many colleagues in the field of atmospheric chemistry and the members of the related IUPAC Commissions (Chemical Kinetics: I.4; Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy: I.5; Photochemistry: III.3: Analytical Nomenclature: V.3), IUPAC Divisions (Physical Chemistry: I; Inorganic Chemistry: II; Organic Chemistry: III; Macromolecular: IV; Analytical Chemistry: V; Applied Chemistry: VI; Clinical Chemistry: VII), and the Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols who reviewed the material and provided helpful suggestions. We also made extensive use of several sources of information: the IUPAC <i>Compendium of chemical terminology</i> (1987); the IUPAC book on <i>Quantities, units und symbols in physical chemistry</i> (1988); <i>Air quality</i> --<i>Performance characteristics and related concepts for air quality measuring methods</i>, <i>International Standard</i>, ISO 6879-1983 (E); <i>Air quality--General aspects--Units of measurement</i>, International Standard, ISO 4226-1980 (E); <i>Gas analysis--Vocabulary</i>, First edition, 1984, International Standard, ISO 7504; <i>Air quality&#183;--General Aspects-- Vocabulary</i>, First edition 1980, International Standard, ISO 4225; <i>Standard definitions of terms relating to atmospheric sampling and analysis</i>, ANSI/ASTM D 1356-73A.<sup>*</sup>Text which is preceded by the designation <B>GB</B> in this Glossary was taken directly from the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1987, "the Gold Book".	#

#GLOSSARY OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY TERMS	 	#
Abatement:: Action taken to reduce air pollution which involves the use of control equipment or some new process. This refers to a reduction or lessening as opposed to elimination of a type of discharge or pollutant.	
Absorbance:: The logarithm (must be specified as to base 10, lg, or base e, ln) of the reciprocal of transmittance [ln(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>t</sub>) or lg(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>t</sub>)], where <i>I</i><sub>o</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>t</sub> are the monochromatic radiances (intensities) of light incident on and transmitted through, respectively, a sample which is usually contained in a sample cell.	
Absorber:: A device used commonly for sampling by absorption in which a gaseous or liquid material is removed from another gas or liquid by selective absorption; these include: scrubber, impinger, packed column, spray chamber, etc. <B>GB</B> A substance used to absorb energy form any type of radiation.	
Absorptance:: <B>GB</B> The ratio of absorbed to incident radiant or luminous flux.	
Absorption-factor:: <B>GB</B> The ratio of absorbed to incident radiant or luminous flux.	
Absorption:: The process of one material (absorbent) being retained by another (absorbate); this may be the physical solution of a gas, liquid, or solid in a liquid, attachment of molecules of a gas, vapour, liquid, or dissolved substance to a solid surface by physical forces, etc. In spectrophotometry, absorption of light at characteristic wavelengths or bands of wavelengths is used to identify the chemical nature of molecules, atoms or ions and to measure the concentrations of these species. <B>GB</B>: The transfer of a component from one phase to another.	
Absorption coefficient:: Quantity used to specify the absorption of light at a given wavelength by a pure compound; it is the constant &#101; which appears in the Beer-Lambert law: lg(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>t</sub>) = [<i>A</i>]<i>l&#101; </i>, where <i>I</i><sub>o</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>t</sub> are the incident and transmitted monochromatic radiances (intensities), respectively for an optical path of length <i>l</i> and uniform concentration of absorbing compound [<i>A</i>] (commonly mol L<sup>-1</sup>, coherent SI units; mol m<sup>-3</sup>). The coefficient &#101; is sometimes called the (decadic) molar absorption coefficient. Although it is sometimes referred to as the extinction coefficient, this is not a good practice since extinction strictly implies the sum of absorption and scattering. There are several useful forms of this relation which are used in describing light absorption. When napierian (natural) logarithms are used, the symbol &#107; is recommended with the name napierian molar absorption coefficient or molar cross section. Pressure of a gas (STP) may be used rather than concentration, etc. See also <i>absorption cross section</i>. The specific form of the law employed (base of the logarithms. concentration, and pathlength units) must be stated with absorption coefficient data derived from it if the data are to be of use to the scientific community.	
Absorption cross section:: A constant (&#115; <i> </i>) in the following relation describing the absorption of light of a given wavelength: ln(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>t</sub>) = [<i>A</i>&#93; <i>l&#115; </i>; here <i>I</i><sub>o</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>t</sub> are the monochromatic radiances (intensities) of the incident and transmitted light, [<i>A</i>] is the concentration (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>), and <i>l</i> is the path length (cm); &#115; (units of cm<sup>-2</sup>/molecule commonly) is related to the molar cross section &#107; by: &#115; = &#107; /<i>N</i><sub>A</sub> where <i>N</i><sub>A</sub> is the Avogadro constant (6.02213 x 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>).	
Absorption line:: A narrow range of wavelengths in which a substance absorbs light; a series of discrete absorption lines can be used as an unambiguous identification for many relatively simple chemical species.
Absorption spectrum:: The wavelength dependence of the absorption cross section (or absorption coefficient); usually represented as a plot of absorption cross section versus wavelength &#108; (or 1/&#108;) of the light.
Accommodation coefficient:: Also sticking coefficient. A measure of the efficiency of capture of molecules or atoms which collide with aerosol particles, cloud droplets, etc. The accommodation coefficient is the fraction of the collisions which result in the capture of the molecules (atoms, radicals, etc.) by the particle, cloud droplet, etc.,; fraction of colliding molecules which are not reflected but which enter the surface of an aqueous aerosol.
Accretion:: The process by which aerosols grow in size by external addition of various chemical species; a form of agglomeration.
Accuracy:: The closeness of agreement between the true value and the measured value. The definition given by the ISO International Standard for reference: Agreement between a single measured value, <i></i><sub>a</sub>, and the value of air quality characteristic, <i>C</i><sub>a</sub>, itself, or the accepted reference value; accuracy denotes the extent to which bias and random errors are absent.
Acid:: A species which reacts in liquid water to generate hydrogen ions (conventionally represented as cations H<sup>+</sup> or hydronium, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>); anions (e.g., sulphate, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>; nitrate, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) which were associated with the H<sup>+</sup> in the acid are also released. Important acids in the atmosphere include sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), and organic acids (e.g., formic acid, HCO<sub>2</sub>H; acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, etc.). <B>GB</B>: <i>Br&oslash;nsted acid</i>: A molecular entity capable of donating a proton to a base, (i.e. a "proton donor") or the corresponding chemical species. For example: H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. <B>GB</B>: <i>Lewis acid</i>: A molecular entity (and the corresponding chemical species) that is an electron-pair acceptor and therefore able to react with a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct, by sharing the electron pair furnished by the Lewis base. For example: Me<sub>3</sub>B + :NH<sub>3</sub> --&gt; Me<sub>3</sub>B<sup><sup>-</sup></sup> - <sup><sup>+</sup></sup>NH<sub>3</sub>Lewis acid + Lewis base --&gt; Lewis adduct<B>GB</b>: <i>Hard acid</i>: A Lewis acid with an acceptor centre of low polarizability. It preferentially associates with hard bases rather than with soft bases, in a qualitative sense. For example, the hard O- (or N-) bases are preferred to their S- (or P-) analogues. Conversely a soft acid possesses an acceptor centre of high polarizability and exhibits the reverse preference of a partner for co-ordination. These preferences are not defined in a quantitative sense.
Br&oslash;nsted acid:: <B>GB</B>: <i>Br&oslash;nsted acid</i>: A molecular entity capable of donating a proton to a base, (i.e. a "proton donor") or the corresponding chemical species. For example: H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. <B>GB</B>: <i>Lewis acid</i>: A molecular entity (and the corresponding chemical species) that is an electron-pair acceptor and therefore able to react with a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct, by sharing the electron pair furnished by the Lewis base. For example: Me<sub>3</sub>B + :NH<sub>3</sub> --&gt; Me<sub>3</sub>B<sup><sup>-</sup></sup> - <sup><sup>+</sup></sup>NH<sub>3</sub>Lewis acid + Lewis base --&gt; Lewis adduct<B>GB</b>: <i>Hard acid</i>: A Lewis acid with an acceptor centre of low polarizability. It preferentially associates with hard bases rather than with soft bases, in a qualitative sense. For example, the hard O- (or N-) bases are preferred to their S- (or P-) analogues. Conversely a soft acid possesses an acceptor centre of high polarizability and exhibits the reverse preference of a partner for co-ordination. These preferences are not defined in a quantitative sense.
Lewis acid:: <B>GB</B>: <i>Lewis acid</i>: A molecular entity (and the corresponding chemical species) that is an electron-pair acceptor and therefore able to react with a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct, by sharing the electron pair furnished by the Lewis base. For example: Me<sub>3</sub>B + :NH<sub>3</sub> --&gt; Me<sub>3</sub>B<sup><sup>-</sup></sup> - <sup><sup>+</sup></sup>NH<sub>3</sub>Lewis acid + Lewis base --&gt; Lewis adduct
Hard acid::<B>GB</b>: <i>Hard acid</i>: A Lewis acid with an acceptor centre of low polarizability. It preferentially associates with hard bases rather than with soft bases, in a qualitative sense. For example, the hard O- (or N-) bases are preferred to their S- (or P-) analogues. Conversely a soft acid possesses an acceptor centre of high polarizability and exhibits the reverse preference of a partner for co-ordination. These preferences are not defined in a quantitative sense.
Acid deposition:: The acids deposited by transfer from the atmosphere either by precipitation (rain, fog, snow, etc.), called <i>wet deposition</i>, or by direct transfer to the surface of the earth induced by the flow of acid-containing air masses over the earth's surface, called dry deposition.
Acid rain:: Rain with pH values &lt; about 5; commonly results from acids formed from pollutants. "Pure" rain water equilibrated with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and naturally occurring acids in relatively clean air usually has a pH &gt; 5.<i>Actinic flux</i> (<i>S&#108;</i>): The quantity of light available to molecules at a particular point in the atmosphere and which, on absorption, drives photochemical processes in the atmosphere. It is calculated by integrating the spectral radiance <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;) over all directions of incidence of the light, º&#113;º&#102; &#123;<i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;)/(<i>hc</i>/&#108;))&#125; sin&#113; d&#113;<i> </i>d&#102;<i>.</i> If the radiance is expressed in J m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> st<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup> and <i>hc</i>/&#108; is the energy per quantum of light of wavelength &#108;, the actinic flux has units of quanta cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>. This important quantity is one of the terms required in the calculation of <i>j</i>-values, the first order rate coefficients for photochemical processes in the sunlight-absorbing, trace gases in the atmosphere. The actinic flux is determined by the solar radiation entering the atmosphere and by any changes in this due to atmospheric gases and particles (e.g., Rayleigh scattering, absorption by stratospheric ozone, scattering and absorption by aerosols and clouds), and reflections from the ground. It is therefore dependent on the wavelength of the light, on the altitude, and on specific local environmental conditions. The actinic flux has borne many names (e.g., flux, flux density, beam irradiance, actinic irradiance, integrated intensity) which has caused some confusion. It is important to distinguish the actinic flux from the spectral irradiance, which refers to energy arrival on a flat surface having fixed spatial orientation (J m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>) given by <i>E</i>(&#108;) = º&#113;º&#102; <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;) cos&#113;<i> </i> sin&#113;<i> </i>d&#102; d&#102; . The actinic flux does not refer to any specific orientation because molecules are oriented randomly in the atmosphere. This distinction is of practical relevance: the actinic flux (and therefore a <i>j</i>-value) near a brightly reflecting surface (e.g., over snow, or above a thick cloud) can be a factor of three higher than that near a non-reflecting surface. The more descriptive name of <i>spectral</i> <i>spheradiance</i> is suggested for the quantity herein called actinic flux. See also <i>flux density, photon</i>.
Activity, absolute:: (<B>GB</B>) The absolute activity &#108;<sub>B</sub> of a substance B in a mixture of substances B, C,... is a number defined by<i>&#108;</i><sub>B</sub> = exp(&#109;<sub>B</sub>/<i>RT</i>) or &#109;<sub>B</sub> = <i>RT</i>ln&#108;<sub>B</sub>where &#109;<sub>B</sub> is the <i>chemical potential</i> of the substance B and <i>R</i> is the gas constant.
Activity, relative:: (<B>GB</B>) Of a solute substance B in a solution (especially in a dilute liquid solution) containing molalities <i>m</i><sub>B</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>C</sub>,..., of solute substances B, C,..., in a solvent substance A, <i>a</i><sub>B</sub> is a number defined in terms of the absolute activity &#108;<sub>B</sub> by<i>a</i><sub>B</sub> = (&#108;<sub>B</sub>/<i>m</i><sup>&oslash;</sup>)/(&#108;<sub>B</sub>/<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)&#165; = <i>m</i><sub>B&#103;B</sub>/<i>m</i><sup>&oslash;</sup> (<i>T</i>, <i>p</i> constant)or in terms of the chemical potential &#109;<sub>B</sub> by<i>RT</i>ln<i>a</i><sub>B</sub> = &#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; <i>RT</i>ln<i>m</i><sup>&oslash;</sup> &#151; (&#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; <i>RT</i>ln<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)&#165; = <i>RT</i>ln(<i>m</i><sub>B&#103;B</sub>/<i>m</i><sup>&oslash;</sup>)where <i>m</i><sup>&oslash;</sup> is a standard value of molality (usually chosen to be 1 mol kg<sup>-1</sup>), &#103;<sub>B</sub> is the activity coefficient of B, <i>R</i> is the gas constant, <i>T</i> is the thermodynamic temperature, and <i>p</i> is the pressure. The superscript &#165; denotes infinite dilution.
Activity coefficient:: The coefficient (&#103;) measures the degree of departure of a component in solution from ideal behavior. It relates concentration &#91;<i>A</i>] and activity (<i>a</i>) for a substance in solution: <i>a</i> = &#103;[<i>A</i>]. The concentrations and activities of components are often given in molal units (mol kg<sup>-1</sup> of solute). The activity coefficient, &#103;, is usually determined empirically; it depends not only upon the concentration of the substance but on its particular properties and on the concentration and kind of other substances present. As the concentration of the solute approaches zero, the activity coefficient approaches unity. <B>GB</B>: The activity coefficient &#103;<sub>B</sub> of a single substance B in a solution (especially in a dilute liquid solution) containing molalities <i>m</i><sub>B</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>C</sub>,..., of solute substances B, C,..., in a solvent substance A, is a number defined in terms of the absolute activity &#103;<sub>B</sub> of the solute substance B in the solution by<i>&#103;</i><sub>B</sub> = (&#108;<sub>B</sub>/<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)/(&#108;<sub>B</sub>/<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)&#165; (<i>T</i>, <i>p</i> constant)or in terms of the chemical potential &#109;<sub>B</sub> by<i>RT</i>ln(<i>m</i><sub>B&#103;B</sub>) = &#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; (&#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; <i>RT</i>ln<i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)&#165; (<i>T</i>, <i>p</i> constant)where the superscript &#165; denotes infinite dilution. The activity coefficient &#131;<sub>B</sub> of a substance B in a liquid or solid mixture containing mole fractions <i>x</i><sub>B</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>C</sub>,&#133;, of the substances B, C,..., is a number defined in terms of the absolute activity &#108;<sub>B</sub> of the substance B in the mixture by&#131;<sub>B</sub> = &#108;<sub>B</sub>/&#108;<sub>B</sub><sup>*</sup><i>x</i><sub>B</sub>where &#108;<sub>B</sub><sup>*</sup> is the absolute activity of the pure substance B at the same temperature and pressure, or in terms of the chemical potential &#109;<sub>B</sub> by<i>RT</i>ln(<i>x</i><sub>B</sub>&#131;<sub>B</sub>) = &#109;<sub>B</sub> &#151; &#109;<sub>B</sub><sup>*</sup>and &#109;<sub>B</sub><sup>*</sup> is the chemical potential of the pure substance B at the same temperature and pressure.
Adiabatic lapse rate:: The rate of decrease in temperature with increase in altitude of an air parcel which is expanding slowly to a lower atmospheric pressure without exchange of heat; for a descending parcel it is the rate of increase in temperature with decrease in altitude. Theory predicts that for dry air it is equal to the acceleration of gravity divided by the specific heat of dry air at constant pressure (approximately 9.8 &#176;C/km). The moist adiabatic lapse rate is less than the dry adiabatic lapse rate and depends on the moisture content of the air mass.
Adsorbate:: A molecular species of gas, dissolved substance or liquid which adheres to or is adsorbed in an extremely thin surface layer of a solid substance. <B>GB</B>: The material accumulated on the surface of an adsorbent by the process of adsorption.
Adsorbent:: An adsorbent is the solid material to which another species is adsorbed in a surface layer. <B>GB</B>: A condensed phase at the surface of which adsorption may occur.
Adrsorber:: Solid material used to capture either a gas or liquid; often activated carbon is employed as the solid because of its high surface area per unit mass.
Adsorption:: The process by which molecules of gas, dissolved substances, or liquids adhere to the surface of solids through either weak physical forces (physical adsorption) or stronger chemical forces (chemical adsorption). <B>GB</B>: The enrichment (positive adsorption, or briefly, adsorption) of one or more components in an interfacial layer.
Advection:: The transport of air, its properties (such as heat), trace materials, fog, cold air, etc., solely by mass motion of the atmosphere, generally in a horizontal direction.
Aeration:: The process by which a volume filled with a liquid becomes permeated with air or another gas; aeration is often accomplished by spraying the liquid into the air, bubbling air through a liquid, or agitating the liquid to promote surface absorption of air.
Aerometer::Instrument used to measure the density of gases.
Aerometric measurements:: Measurements of the temperature, pressure, air motion (velocity vectors), or other physical measurements to characterize an air mass.
Aerosol:: Mixtures of small particles (solid, liquid, or a mixed variety) and the carrier gas (usually air); owing to their size, these particles (usually less than 100 &#109;m and greater than 0.01 &#109;m in diameter) have a comparatively small settling velocity and hence exhibit some degree of stability in the earth's gravitational field. An aerosol may be characterized by its chemical composition, its radioactivity, the particle size distribution, the electrical charge and the optical properties. <B>GB</B>: Aerosols are dispersions in gases. In aerosols the particles often exceed the usual size limits for colloids. If the dispersed particles are solid, one speaks of aerosols of solid particles, if they are liquid of "aerosols of liquid particles". The use of the terms "solid aerosol" and "liquid aerosol" is discouraged. An aerosol is neither "solid" nor "liquid", but if anything, gaseous.&#9;
Agglomeration:: The growth of particles in size due to an attachment of other particles following collisions. The term refers to aerosol particles, cloud droplets, etc.
#Air, composition of pure:: The composition of air is variable with respect to several of its components (e.g., CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O) so "pure" air has no precise meaning; it is commonly considered to be air which is free of dust, aerosols, and reactive gaseous contaminants of anthropogenic origin. The composition of the major components in dry air is relatively constant (percent by volume given): nitrogen, 78.084; oxygen, 20.946; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide, 0.033; neon, 0.0018; helium, 0.000524; methane, 0.00016, krypton 0.000114; hydrogen 0.00005; nitrous oxide, 0.00003; xenon, 0.0000087. The concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the chlorofluorocarbons and some other species of anthropogenic origin are increasing measurably with time. Relative clean air which is free of most reactive anthropogenic pollution (NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, non-methane hydrocarbons, etc.), often used as a reference sample in the calibration and operation of instruments, is purchased under the designation of zero <i>air</i>.
Air mass:: A qualitative term to describe a widespread body of air with approximately uniform characteristics which had been identified at a given time over a particular region of the earth's surface. Sometimes an air mass is marked by inert tracers such as SF<sub>6</sub> which may be added to it. The composition of a given air mass undergoes alteration as it migrates, chemical changes occur, compounds are removed by dry and wet deposition, and new impurities are added to the mass.
Air monitoring station:: A site at which monitoring of the concentration of one or more pollutants is carried out (e.g., the BAPMoN stations. Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network of the WMO, World Meteorological Organization).
Air pollutant:: A substance, gaseous material or aerosol which has been introduced into the air (either by human activity or by natural processes) in sufficient concentration to produce a measurable effect on humans, animals, vegetation, or materials (monuments, etc.): SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, CO, hydrocarbons, etc.
Air pollution:: Usually the presence of substances in the atmosphere, resulting either from human activity or natural processes, present in sufficient concentration, for a sufficient time and under circumstances such as to interfere with comfort, health or welfare of persons or the environment.
Air pollution control:: Measures taken to control the purity of the air to some degree specified by law.
Air pollution control district:: A geographical region designated by law in which the emissions of some specified air pollutants are controlled to a degree specified by law.
Air pollution index:: A mathematical combination of the concentrations of air pollutants (weighted in some fashion to reflect the estimated health impact of the specific pollutant) which gives an approximate numerical measure of the quality of the air at a given time. These indices have little scientific basis but have been used to inform the public (in a qualitative fashion) of the degree of pollution present at a given time. It is recommended that the actual measured pollutant concentrations be used by all information services when possible with simultaneous reference given to the corresponding concentrations which are considered by health authorities to be hazardous to human health.	
Air quality index:: A mathematical combination of the concentrations of air pollutants (weighted in some fashion to reflect the estimated health impact of the specific pollutant) which gives an approximate numerical measure of the quality of the air at a given time. These indices have little scientific basis but have been used to inform the public (in a qualitative fashion) of the degree of pollution present at a given time. It is recommended that the actual measured pollutant concentrations be used by all information services when possible with simultaneous reference given to the corresponding concentrations which are considered by health authorities to be hazardous to human health.	
Air pollution survey:: A study of the concentrations and geographical distribution of specified air pollutants in a given area and an assessment of the damage, if any, which the pollutants have caused.	
Air quality characteristic:: One of the quantifiable properties relating to an air sample: concentration of a constituent, wind speed, temperature, etc. The <i>quantity of air quality characteristic</i> is the true value of the characteristic being investigated; it is recognized that in practice, this value can only be approximated by existing methods.	
Air resource management:: The detailed planning and the implementation of air pollution control programs designed to preserve the health and welfare of the people in the region, the plant and animal life, physical property, good visibility, and other factors which determine the air quality and the maintenance of an aesthetically acceptable environment.	
Air sampling network:: A number of air sampling stations which are established in a given geographical region at which measurements of both pollutant concentrations and meteorological quantities (wind speed, direction, rain fall, humidity, etc.) are made to determine the extent and the nature of the air pollution and to establish trends in the concentrations of the air pollutants with time.	
Aitken particles:: Aerosol particles below 0.1 &#109;m in diameter. These generally are the most numerous among all particles in the air. Their concentrations can be determined with the Aitken counter which measures total particle number density. Owing to their small size, Aitken particles contribute little to the total <i>mass</i> concentration of all aerosol particles; this is determined primarily by particles of diameter &gt; 0.1 &#109;m.	
Albedo:: The fraction of the energy of electromagnetic radiation reflected from a body (or surface) relative to the energy incident upon it. The reflection of light from a surface is, of course, dependent on the wavelength of the light, the nature of the surface, and its angle of incidence with the surface. The term <i>albedo</i> usually connotes a broad wavelength band (visible, ultraviolet, or infrared), whereas the terms <i>reflectivity</i> and <i>spectral albedo</i> are used to describe the reflection of monochromatic (single wavelength or small band of wavelengths) radiation.	
Aldehyde:: A class of organic compound of general formula: R(C=O)H, where R is an hydrogen atom or hydrocarbyl group (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc.). These are products of hydrocarbon oxidation. The simplest aldehydes are formaldehyde (methanal, CH<sub>2</sub>O), acetaldehyde (ethanal, CH<sub>3</sub>CHO), and propionaldehyde (propanal, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO). Aldehydes absorb sunlight (&#108; &lt; 330 nm) and generate radicals. They also react rapidly with HO-radicals in the atmosphere to produce acyl (RCO) and acylperoxyl (RCOO<sub>2</sub>) radicals. Formaldehyde is the most abundant aldehyde in the atmosphere (formed from the natural hydrocarbon, CH<sub>4</sub>, as well as other hydrocarbons) where its mixing ratios are often &gt; 0.2 ppbv even in relatively clean air. Acetaldehyde is a major precursor to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) in the troposphere.	
Alert levels:: Designated concentrations of certain key pollutants at which some degree of danger to public health is expected. In many areas in which a relatively high level of pollution is often encountered, several levels of alert are often established. For example, a first alert may signify a potential problem exists; a second alert becomes a signal for the curtailment of certain significant emission sources; the third alert signifies the need for some specified emergency action which must be taken to ensure the public safety.	
Aliquot:: A representative portion of the whole.	
Ambient air:: The outdoor air in the particular location.	
Ambient air quality:: A general term used to describe the quality of the outside air. Usually adjectives such as good, fair, bad, etc. are used by the media to describe this; often some form of <i>air pollution or air quality index</i> is employed to determine the specific descriptive term to be used. These are very qualitative terms of little or no scientific value. See also <i>air pollution index</i>, <i>air quality index</i>.	
Ames/salmonella test:: A screening test employed in predicting the mutagenic and the potential carcinogenic activities of chemicals in the environment. It employs Ames test strains of salmonella bacteria (<i>his</i><sup>-</sup>) which lack the ability to produce histidine. The compound to be tested, the bacteria and a small amount of histidine (insufficient to permit colony growth but enough to allow sufficient growth for expression of mutations) are added to agar. The bacteria are allowed to incubate for about 63 hours at 37 &#176;C. If a significant increase in colonies above background is observed in the sample containing the test compound, then it is concluded that the chemical tested is a direct mutagen for the particular Ames strain of bacteria. This is taken as a qualitative indication of the <i>possible</i> carcinogenic activity of this chemical in other biological systems. This procedure seems to be of qualitative value in a preliminary screening of potential carcinogens.

The volume ratio of any component in the resulting mixture is calculated from the ratio of the volume flow rates. Deviations from ideality of the mixture must be known in order to calculate the mole ratio unless the flow rates are measured in mass flow per unit time for all gases; in this case the mass or mole ratio can be directly calculated. <i>e) Saturation method</i>: A method in which a stream of gas is passed over or through a substance capable of evaporation or sublimation held at a fixed temperature. At equilibrium the concentration of the substance in the stream of gas will be determined by the vapour pressure of the substance at the temperature given. <i>f) Permeation method</i>: A method in which a stream of gas is passed over a porous or permeable tube or vessel containing a volatile substance usually present as the liquid and saturated vapour phases. The permeation rate of the substance through the walls of the tube should be constant at any given temperature as long as sufficient liquid and its vapour remain in the tube. The concentration of the substance in the stream of gas is determined by the rate of flow of the gas stream and the permeation rate of the substance.

For example, in the Cl<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub> system which is irradiated within the Cl<sub>2</sub> absorption band, the reaction is initiated by the photodissociation of Cl<sub>2</sub>: Cl<sub>2</sub> + h&#110; --&gt; 2Cl. The propagation steps involve the reaction and reformation of Cl atoms: Cl + H<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HCl + H; H + Cl<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HCl + Cl; eventually termination occurs largely through the reassociation of Cl atoms: 2Cl + M --&gt; Cl<sub>2</sub> + M. M is a third body which removes some of energy released by the formation of C1, and allows it to be stabilized. The C1,-H, system can have a chain length of up to a million at low light intensities; i.e., 106 molecules of HCIcan form for each Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule photodissociated. In the atmosphere the oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> which occurs in the sunlight-irradiated mixture of NO<sub>x</sub> and hydrocarbons, a complex series of chain reactions occur involving HO-, HO<sub>2</sub>-, and RO<sub>2</sub>-radicals, NO, hydrocarbons, and their oxidation products. <B>GB</B>: In chain polymerization reactions, reactive intermediates of the same type, generated in successive steps or cycles of steps, differ in molecular mass, as inRCH<sub>2</sub>CHPh + H<sub>2</sub>C=CHPh --&gt; RCH<sub>2</sub>CHPhCH<sub>2</sub>CHPh

In both cases, the stationary phase may either be a liquid (often chemically bonded to the support) in which the components selectively dissolve, or a solid on which they are selectively adsorbed. Ion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography are useful for the separation and analysis of the ions present in rain-water or cloud-water. <B>GB</B>: The stationary phase may be packed in a column, spread as a layer, or distributed as a film, etc,; in these definitions chromatographic bed is used as a general term to denote any of the different forms in which the stationary phase may be use.

Coagulation:: Process of converting a finely divided or colloidally dispersed suspension of one substance (usually a solid) in a liquid into larger-size particles which do settle or precipitate under the influence of gravity. Aluminum sulfate or other salt which contains a trivalent or divalent metal ion is sometimes used for this purpose. For atmospheric aerosol, coagulation denotes the process by which particles grow due to the attachment of smaller, more mobile particles subject to Brownian motions. Aitken particles coagulate efficiently with larger particles. <B>GB</B>: When a sol is colloidally unstable (i.e. the rate of aggregation is not negligible) the formation of aggregates is called coagulation or flocculation.

Coal desulfurization:: Processes by which sulfur compounds are removed from coal. Some of the sulfur content of coal is composed of iron pyrites (FeS) which has a density (about 5 g cm<sup>-3</sup>) very different from that of coal (1.25-1.45 g cm<sup>-3</sup>) and can be removed by mechanical cleaning processes. Many processes have been used to remove SO<sub>2</sub> from flue gases and others are under study: limestone scrubbing, catalytic oxidation, fluidized bed reactors, etc.
Coefficient of haze:: One technique of measurement of the amount of filterable particulate matter suspended in air which has been used in the past depends upon drawing a measured sample of air (usually 1000 linear feet) through a paper or membrane filter. A measurement is made of the intensity of light transmitted through the dust spot formed relative to that transmitted through an identical clean filter. The dirtiness of the air is reported in terms of the COH unit. This relates to the quantity of particulate material which produces an optical density, lg(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i>) of 0.01 when measured by light transmission at 400 nm and relative to the transmission of an identical dust-free filter taken as 100%. Thus a filter which transmitted 50% relative to the clean filter has an absorbance of 0.301 or 30.1 COH units. This is not a recommended measure of filterable particulate matter since the size, color and other properties of the aerosol and the air in which it is suspended affect the results.
Collection efficiency:: A term which characterizes an entire sampling and sample pretreatment procedure, usually represented as a percentage of the original amount of the analyte which is left for measurement (signal formation) after having passed through this procedure. This term also applies to the effciency of collection of an air pollutant by an arrestment plant. For particulates, the collection efficiency is size related.
Collector:: A device for removing and retaining contaminants from air or other gases. Term which is often applied to cleaning devices in exhaust systems. Also used to designate a device for removing and retaining samples from media in different environmental compartments to be investigated. A collector is sometimes used to describe a scavenger. <B>GB</B>: A solid substance added to or formed within a solution to collect a micro- or macro-component.
Collision number (z) or collision frequency:: The number of collisions between two molecules <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> which occur per unit volume per unit time when both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are at a concentration of one molecule per unit volume; <i>z</i><sub>AB</sub> = &#115;<sub>AB</sub><sup>2&#123;</sup>8&#112;<i>kT</i>(<i>m</i><sub>A</sub> + <i>m</i><sub>B</sub>)/<i>m</i><sub>A</sub><i>m</i><sub>B&#125;</sub><sup>1/2</sup>, where &#115;<sub>AB</sub> = (&#115;<sub>A</sub> + &#115;<sub>B</sub>)/2, &#115;<sub>A</sub> and &#115;<sub>B</sub> are the diameters of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively, assumed to be rigid spheres, <i>k</i> is the Boltzmann constant, and <i>m</i><sub>A</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>B</sub> are the masses of the molecules <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively. The number of <i>A-B</i> collisions cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> is given by <i>z</i>[<i>A</i>][<i>B</i>], where [<i>A</i>] and [<i>B</i>] are the concentration (molecules per unit volume) of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively. Conventional units for <i>z</i> are number of collisions cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. <B>GB</B>: In simple collision theory the rate coefficient of a bimolecular reaction between A and B is expressed as<i>k</i> = <i>p</i><sub>AB</sub><i>z</i><sub>AB</sub>e<sup>-E/RT</sup>where <i>p</i><sub>AB</sub> the steric factor, allows for the fact that, even when the energy requirements are satisfied, all collisions are not effective in causing reaction.

Combustion chamber:: The region within which solids, vapours and gases from the primary chamber are burned and the some settling of fly ash takes place.
Combustion gases:: Gases and vapours produced in furnaces, combustion chambers or in open burning.
Complementary gas:: Generally the most abundant component (pure gas or gas mixture) which makes up the mixture intended for the calibration.
Concentration, gas and liquid solutions:: This represents the quantity of matter (mol, g, molecules, or other) per unit of volume (cm<sup>3</sup>, L, m<sup>3</sup>, or other). The IUPAC <B>GB</B> designation of this quantity is the amount of substance concentration (with the SI base unit of mol m<sup>-1</sup>, but practical units of mol dm<sup>-3</sup> or mol L<sup>-1</sup>). For a gas phase species it is common to describe the concentration as the number of molecules of the particular species per cm<sup>3</sup> of air; this unit is most common in gas phase kinetics and in calculations involving chemical changes in the atmosphere. The number concentration or number density, often employed in physics and in physical chemistry, describes the number of molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>; however in writing the units for this quantity, molecules are understood but omitted; only cm is written. The most common method of describing concentration of a given solute in the liquid phase (such as cloud-water) is the amount of the compound or ion (in moles) present per litre of the solution. One mole of a given species is 6.02213 x 10<sup>23</sup> (Avogadro constant) of these species. The mixing ratio is also employed as a measure of relative concentration. For a non-reactive gas, the mixing ratio does not change with altitude although the absolute concentration (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>) decreases. Thus one part-per-million by volume (1 ppmv) is a concentration equivalent to one molecule of a given species present in one million molecules (10<sup>6</sup>) of air. Similarly one part-per-billion by volume (1 ppbv) represents a molecular ratio of one molecule for every 10<sup>9</sup> molecules of air; one part-per-trillion by volume (1 pptv) represents one molecule per 10<sup>12</sup> molecules of air. Concentrations of solids suspended in air are sometimes given in units of mass of the species per unit volume (e.g., micrograms per cubic meter of air). At times the mass fraction is used in contrast to the use of the volume, molecule, or mole fraction (e.g., ppmv); thus one part-per-million by mass (ppmm) is one unit of mass of a given species per million mass units of the mixture.
Concentration, ground level:: The concentration of a chemical species, normally a pollutant, in air; usually measured at a specific height above the ground.
Concentration, particle:: Commonly expressed in several ways: mass concentration (usually as &#109;g m~3) or number concentration (number of particles cm<sup>-3</sup>); modern instrumentation allows measurement of the number of particles as a function of size as well as the total number present in a given air volume. For atmospheric aerosols, this is a complex distribution for which diameters range from below 0.01 to above 100 &#109;m; the particles making the highest contribution to the total number density are in the size range below 0.1 &#109;m, those contributing most to the total surface area are in the 0.1 to 1.0 &#109;m range, while those with the highest contribution to the volume or mass of the aerosol come from both the 0.1 to 1.0 and 1.0 to 100 &#109;m ranges.
Condensation:: The physical process of converting a material from a gaseous or vapour phase to a liquid or solid phase; this commonly results when the temperature is lowered and/or the vapour pressure of the material is increased. The tendency exists for condensation to occur when the partial pressure of a given component of a gaseous mixture at a given temperature exceeds the vapour pressure of the liquid or solid form of that component at the given temperature.<i>Condensation nuclei</i> (sometimes symbolized as CN): A particle, either liquid or solid, or an ion upon which condensation of water vapour (or other substances) begins in the atmosphere. Condensation nuclei are usually very small hygroscopic aerosols (0.001 to 0.1 &#109;m in diameter), but these are not as abundant as the smaller particles. The number of CN which are active (initiate condensation) in a given air mass may be a function of the relative humidity. Usually CN are counted as the active nuclei at about 300% relative humidity, while cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are counted as the number of active nuclei at relative humidity less than or equal to 102%.<i>Constituent</i> (with reference to an air sample): A component of the air sample for which a specified quantity is to be determined by measurement or analysis; see <i>air quality characteristic</i>.

Correlation coefficient:: A measure of the degree of interrelationship which exists between two measured quantities, x and y; the correlation coefficient (f) is defined by the following relation. See defintion of Pearson Correlation coefficient ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient). If <i>x</i> = <i>ay</i> is followed then <i>r</i> = 1, and departures from this relationship decrease <i>r</i>, if interpretations of data based on the linear correlation coefficient are to be made, one should consult a book on statistics.	::#changed definition to point to wikipedia

Deliquescence:: The process that occurs when the vapour pressure of the saturated aqueous solution of a substance is less than the vapour pressure of water in the ambient air. When water vapour is collected by the pure solid compound, a mixture of the solid and liquid, or an aqueous solution of the compound forms until the substance is dissolved and is in equilibrium with its environment; at this time the vapour pressure of water over the aqueous solution will equal the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere in contact with it.

Detector:: An instrument or part of an instrument which indicates the presence of air quality characteristic by means of some specific spectroscopic or chemical property of the pollutant.	
Dew point:: That temperature at which water vapour present in the atmosphere is just sufficient to saturate it.

This term is also applicable to acid gases as in the problem of acid corrosion and acid smut formation.	
Equivalent Diameter:: The diameter of a spherical particle which will give identical geometric, optical, electrical or aerodynamic behavior to that of the particle (non-spherical) being examined; sometimes referred to as the Stokes diameter for particles in non-turbulent flows.	
Diffraction:: A modification which light (or electron, neutron beams, etc.) undergoes in passing by the edges of opaque bodies or through narrow slits or in being reflected from ruled surfaces (or crystalline materials). The light waves, owing to their wave-like nature appear to be deflected and produce fringes of parallel light and dark bands corresponding to regions of constructive reinforcement or destructive interference, respectively, of the waves.

Molecular diffusion is the net transport of molecules which results from their molecular motions alone in the absence of turbulent mixing; it occurs when the concentration gradient of a particular gas in a mixture differs from its equilibrium value. Eddy diffusion is the most important mixing process in the lower atmosphere, while molecular diffusion becomes significant at the lower pressures of the upper atmosphere.

The point or area from which the discharge takes place is called the <i>source</i>; the area in which the emission or its transformed products (e.g., in the case of aerosols, acidic deposition, etc.) may be deposited is called the <i>receptor</i> area or <i>sink</i>. <i>Emission</i> may be applied to noise, heat, etc., as well as pollutants.

Equilibrium:: A dynamic or static state of balance between opposing forces or actions. A dynamic equilibrium exists between two different phases of a given pure compound (liquid-gas, gas-solid, solid-liquid) when there is no net change in the amount of either phase when the two remain in contact; this occurs at a given temperature when the vapour pressures of each of the two phases of the compound are equal.

Consider an equilibrium established in a reversible chemical system containing molecules of A, B, C, and D, which react by the stoichiometry: <i>aA</i> + <i>bB</i> &#8594; <i>cC</i> + <i>dD</i> (where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> are the coefficients of the respective reactants and products in the balanced chemical equation describing the change). When the system is at equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal, and no further change in reactant and product concentrations occurs at a fixed temperature and pressure. At this time the equilibrium constant, <i>K</i><sub>p</sub>, is given by: <i>K</i><sub>p</sub> = [<i>p</i><sub>C</sub>]<sup>c</sup>[<i>p</i><sub>D</sub>]<sup>d</sup>/[<i>p</i><sub>A</sub>]<sup>a</sup>[<i>p</i><sub>B</sub>]<sup>b</sup> where <i>p</i><sub>X</sub> represents the pressure of the <i>X</i> species at equilibrium. Pressures must be replaced by fugacities for systems at high pressures. Equilibrium constants based upon fugacities are symbolized by <i>K</i><sub>f</sub>. For solution phase reactions, concentration units (or activities for concentrated solutions) are employed for the reactant and products, and a similar equilibrium expression can be written: <i>K</i><sub>c</sub> = [<i>C</i>]<sup>c</sup>[<i>D</i>]<sup>d</sup>/[<i>A</i>]<sup>a</sup>[<i>B</i>]<sup>b</sup>. When fugacities or activities are employed, the eguilibrium expressions hold accurately regardless of the starting pressures or concentrations of the reactants and products. For systems at reasonably low pressures (near one atmosphere) or low concentrations, the <i>K</i><sub>f</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>c</sub> expressions given above hold reasonably well.

This is often employed in gas chromatography work. <i>c) Critical orifice flowmeter</i>: A device consisting of a plate having an orifice of small diameter and placed in a gas stream such that the total now passing through the orifice has a velocity at least equal to the sonic velocity. A pressure measuring device is attached upstream of the orifice. The now is proportional to the upstream pressure and independent from the downstream pressure. <i>d) Spirometer</i>: An absolute flow measuring device consisting of two cylinders each sealed at one end and having slightly different diameters. The smaller is inverted into the larger which is filled with a confining liquid. The inverted cylinder is suspended with counterweights so that it moves freely within the larger cylinder. Gas may either be displaced from the smaller cylinder or admitted to it. The dimensions of the smaller cylinder must be known. The rate of rise or fall of the inverted cylinder can be used to calculate the rate of flow of gas either into or out of the spirometer. The device is used principally for calibrating other devices.

This current is reduced when an electronegative substance (such as a halocarbon) is introduced. The reduction in current is a measure of the concentration of the electronegative substance. The detection limit (threshold) varies greatly according to the substances to be analysed and can reach a mixing ratio of 10<sup>-12</sup>. The linear dynamic range may be 10<sup>4</sup> but the maximum measuring value generally lies below 1 ppmv.	::# not sufficiently used in this form - see acronym list
#Gas chromatography, flame ionization detector:: The gases emerging from the column are fed into a hydrogen flame across which an electrical potential is placed. Certain molecules ionize easily in the flame and the current produced is proportional to the instantaneous flow rate of the eluted component. The detector is relatively insensitive to inorganic molecules and is most used for organic compounds. Concentrations below 1 ppmv are easily detected.

#Gas chromatography, helium ionization detector:: A weak beta source and a high potential raise the helium atom of the carrier gas to a metastable state. All other substances having an ionization potential lower than 18 eV are ionized, and the current that results is used to measure the components. The detector is usually employed to measure inorganic compounds at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 ppmv.

Liquid stationary phases are supported on solids, but the solid support affects the chromatographic process. For classification, the term relating to the predominant effect is chosen.	
Gas plume:: The stack effluent which may assume various geometrical forms and concentration distributions which are dependent on the degree of turbulence: <i>a) Looping plumes</i> are formed under conditions of high convective turbulence which may result from the intense solar heating of the earth's surface or from mechanical turbulence induced from nearby hills upwind of the stack; <i>b) Coming plumes</i> which are reasonably symmetrical, occur under more nearly neutral thermal conditions when both convective and mechanical turbulence are relatively low; <i>c) Fanning plumes</i> occur under stable conditions, often at night, when the vertical component of the mechanical turbulence is suppressed more than the horizontal component so that the horizontal plume width is greater than its vertical thickness; <i>d) Fumigating plume</i> is caused by unstable air below and a stable layer above which results in a downward dispersion of gases which is greater than that seen under stable conditions; often occurs in the morning following a night of marked stability as the sun heats the ground to create the instability from the ground upward; <i>e) Lofting plume</i> is caused by conditions inverse to those causing fumigation and results in a greater diffusion upward; the meteorology of late afternoon and early evening often favors this condition.

These have been used extensively in refrigeration, aerosol spray cans, manufacture of insulation, etc. Two common anthropogenic halocarbons are: trichlorofluoromethane (CCl<sub>3</sub>F), designated by the Dupont Company as Freon-11; dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>), designated by the Dupont Company as Freon-12 Several other halocarbons and alkyl halides are used commercially and also appear as trace gases in the atmosphere: tetrachloromethane (or carbon tetrachloride, CCl<sub>4</sub>), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (or methyl chloroform, CCl<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), trichloroethene (or trichloroethylene, CCl<sub>2</sub>=CCHCl), tetrachloroethene (or perchloroethylene, CCl<sub>2</sub>=CCl<sub>2</sub>), dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>). The lifetimes of many of the chlorofluorocarbons (e.g., CClF<sub>3</sub>, CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, etc.) are very long in the troposphere, and the major destruction of these species occurs in the stratosphere where photodecomposition of the halocarbons produces Cl-atoms which are involved in pathways to stratospheric ozone destruction. International agreements are anticipated to control the manufacture and release of the very long-lived halocarbons, and replacement of these by species which are destroyed within the troposphere is anticipated.

Henry's law:: An expression describing the equilibrium partitioning of a gas or vapour between two volumes of a gas and liquid in contact with each other.

Common practice in atmospheric chemistry is the use of concentration in mol L<sup>-1</sup> and pressure of gas in atm with resulting units of mol L<sup>-1</sup> atm<sup>-1</sup> of the Henry's law constant, <i>H</i><sub>x</sub>. The simple form of this law is suitable to describe the solubility in water of many gaseous species which are of atmospheric interest (O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc.), but a modified form of Henry's law must be used to describe the solubility of gases which react with water (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>).

It is a neutral fragment of the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule which is formed largely through the two reaction pathways: a) photolysis of ozone forming O(<sup>1</sup>D) atoms which react with H<sub>2</sub>O, O(<sup>1</sup>D) + H<sub>2</sub>O --&gt; 2HO; b) the reaction of HO<sub>2</sub> radicals with NO, HO<sub>2</sub> + NO --&gt; HO + NO<sub>2</sub>. The HO-radical reacts readily with most hydrocarbons (RH) to generate alkylperoxyl or arylperoxyl radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>), HO + RH --&gt; R + H<sub>2</sub>O; R + O<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RO<sub>2</sub>; aldehydes (RCHO) react to form acylperoxy radicals, RCHO + HO --&gt; RCO + H<sub>2</sub>O; RCO + O<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RCOO<sub>2</sub>. These peroxy radicals react in NO<sub>x</sub>-containing atmospheres to oxidize NO to NO<sub>2</sub>, RO<sub>2</sub> (RCOO<sub>2</sub>)+ NO --&gt; RO (RCO<sub>2</sub>) + NO<sub>2</sub>. The RO radical usually reacts with O<sub>2</sub> to form an HO<sub>2</sub>-radical plus a carbonyl compound. RCO<sub>2</sub> radicals decompose readily, RCO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; R + CO<sub>2</sub>. This set of reactions constitutes a chain reaction involving HO- and HO<sub>2</sub>-radicals which results in the oxidation of many molecules of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> for each HO-radical generated initially. The chain is terminated largely by reaction of HO-radicals with NO<sub>2</sub> or by the occurrence of HO<sub>2</sub>-HO<sub>2</sub> and HO<sub>2</sub>-RO<sub>2</sub> reactions: HO + NO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HNO<sub>3</sub>; 2HO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>; HO<sub>2</sub> + RO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RO<sub>2</sub>H + O<sub>2</sub>. The reaction sequence outlined is responsible for the development of photochemical smog through the generation of NO, and hence O, through its photodissociation reaction.<i>HO<sub>2</sub>-Radical</i>: The hydroperoxyl radical. A reactive radical which, together with the HO-radical, constitute the elements of a radical chain reaction which results in the oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> and ultimately O<sub>3</sub> formation in the troposphere; see <i>HO-radical</i>. The HO<sub>2</sub>-radical is also a major source of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the troposphere through the reaction, 2HO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>.	
Humidity:: A general term referring to the water content of a gas. See <i>relative humidity</i>.	
Hydrocarbon cracking:: See <i>cracking</i>.	
Hydrocarbons:: Compounds which are composed only of carbon and hydrogen atoms.	
#Hydrocarbons:: Compounds which are composed only of carbon and hydrogen atoms. There are several types of hydrocarbons which are in common use as fuels or in the preparation of polymers, etc.; these differ in the type of bonding present in the molecules. <i>a)</i> <i>The Alkanes</i> (sometimes referred to as paraffinic or saturated hydrocarbons) have the general formula, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. Typical members of this family of compounds are: methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), propane (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>), butane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), isobutane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), etc. <i>b)</i> <i>The Alkenes</i> (not recommended are the alternative names, olefinic or unsaturated hydrocarbons, used in some of the older literature): these species are characterized by the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond and have the general formula, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>;<sup>*</sup> typical members of this family of compounds are: ethene (or---------<sup>*</sup>Sometimes, the class name alkene is used to include also alkadienes, alkatrienes, etc. (i.e., in the sense covered by the obsolescent class term olefins) thus denoting hydrocarbons C<sub>n</sub>H,<sub>2n-2x+2</sub> with any number (x) of carbon-carbon double bonds.---------ethylene, CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>), propene (or propylene, CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub>), l-butene (CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), 2-butene (CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>3</sub>, exists in either of two stereoisomers, the <i>cis</i>- or the <i>trans</i>-isomer). <i>c)</i> <i>The Alkynes</i>: (sometimes referred to as the acetylenic hydrocarbons) are characterized by the presence of a carbon-carbon triple bond (-C&quot;aC-), and they have the general formula, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>. The simplest members of this family of compounds are: ethyne (acetylene, HC&quot;aCH), propyne (methylacetylene, CH<sub>3</sub>C&quot;aCH). <i>d) Aromatic hydrocarbons</i> are characterized by the presence of one or more benzene-like rings, i.e., of six-membered carbocyclic rings in which each carbon atom is only tricoordinated and involved in delocalized ring double bonds (bonds of an order between one and two). The simplest members of this family are: benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), toluene (methylbenzene, CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), <i>ortho</i>-xylene (1,2-dimethylbenzene), <i>meta</i>-xylene (1,3-dimethylbenzene), <i>para</i>-xylene (1,4-dimethyibenzene):<img src=Image1.gif width=342 height=79> Benzene&#9; Toluene&#9; <i>o</i>-Xylene&#9; <i>m</i>-Xylene &#9; <i>p</i>-Xylene</DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR><i>e)</i> <i>Cycloalkanes</i> contain a ring of carbon atoms but no multiple bonds. Some common species encountered in this class are: cyclopentane (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) and cyclohexane (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>). <i>f) Cycloalkenes</i> are characterized by the presence of a ring of carbon atoms and double bonded carbon atoms as in the alkenes, an example of this class of hydrocarbon is cyclohexene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>). <i>g) Polycyclic aromatics</i> are aromatic hydrocarbons containing more than one benzene-like ring (cf. section d); an example of this type of species encountered in polluted atmospheres is benzo[<i>def</i>]chrysene (formely called benzo[<i>a</i>]pyrene), C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub>:<img src=Image2.gif width=136 height=81> benzo[<i>def</i>]chrysene <i>h) The natural hydrocarbons</i>: Although many of the hydrocarbons occur in nature, there are several hydrocarbons which are emitted from trees and plants and which are often referred to as the natural hydrocarbons. Typical members of this class are: isoprene (CH<sub>2</sub>=CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH=CH<sub>2</sub>) and &#97; -pinene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>):<img src=Image3.gif width=70 height=77> &#97; -PineneThe reactivity of the various classes of compounds toward the HO-radical and their efficiency in ozone generation in NO<sub>x</sub>-hydrocarbon-containing air parcels varies greatly; the most reactive hydrocarbons are the alkenes, the aromatic hydrocarbons and natural hydrocarbons having hydrogen atoms at saturated carbon atoms adjacent to a double bond (localized or delocalized); the alkanes and alkynes are least reactive. All hydrocarbons are attacked by HO-radicals in the atmosphere, while only the natural hydrocarbons and the alkenes react at significant rates with ozone.	::# subdivisions not needed as found by chemical tagger?
Hydrocracking unit:: Used in the thermal decomposition of heavy (high molecular weight) hydrocarbons to smaller (low molecular weight) hydrocarbons; high pressures of hydrogen and a special catalyst are employed. Sulfur compounds in the fuel are reduced to H<sub>2</sub>S, and the final hydrocarbon product can be obtained relatively sulfur-free.	
Hydrometeor:: Any condensed water particle in the atmosphere of sufficient size to be potentially capable of undergoing precipitation (in fogs, clouds, some hazes, rain-drops, snow-flakes, etc.).	
Hydrosphere:: The gaseous, liquid, and solid water of the earth (oceans, icecaps, lakes, rivers, etc.) as distinguished from the lithosphere and the atmosphere.	
Hygrometry:: The measurement or indication of the water content of the ambient air or of a sample of gas.	
Hygrometer:: Instrument used to measure the water vapour content of the atmosphere. The designs and operations of the various instruments now employed are very different. See the following types:	
capacitance hygrometer:: Hygrometer using the capacitance variations of a capacitor whose dielectric medium consists of the gas or of a material in contact with this gas.	
Dew point hygrometer:: Instrument in which the sample is passed over a cooled surface. The temperature at which dew forms on the cooled surface is a function of the water content of the gas passing over the surface.	
Electrical hygrometer:: A hygrometer whose sensitive element has electrical properties which vary with the humidity of the gas which traverses the hygrometer.	
Electrolytic hygrometer:: Hygrometer using a hygroscopic substance (for example, diphosphorus pentoxide, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) which is transformed into an electrolyte (phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) in contact with the moisture in the gas. The electrolyte (phosphoric acid) is electrolysed continuously and the electrolysis current is measured. At a constant flow of the gas to be analysed, the electrolysis current is a linear function of the water concentration.	
Frost point hygrometer:: Instrument in which the sample is passed over a cooled surface. The temperature at which frost forms on it is a function of the water content of the gas passing over the surface.	
Mechanical hygrometer:: An apparatus containing an element (hair, goldbeater's skin, carbon-film) whose dimension or mass varies as a function of its water content.	
Psychrometric hygrometer:: Instrument by which the relative humidity of the atmosphere may be determined. It is generally composed of two temperature sensors, one of which measures the temperature of the air; the other sensor is moistened with water and senses the cooling due to evaporation of water. The temperature difference between the two sensors is a function of relative humidity; sometimes referred to as a wet- and dry-bulb hygrometer.
Hysteresis:: Regarding a material quantity or instrument's reading. Dependence of a value on the direction of change from a previous characteristic value. It may be quantified by the difference between the upscale and downscale variation starting from fixed lower and upper measurement points (inversion).
Ideal gas:: A gas is considered ideal when its pressure, temperature, and volume follow the relationship: <i>pV</i> = <i>nRT</i> where <i>p</i> is the pressure, <i>V</i> is the volume, <i>n</i> is the number of moles of gas present, <i>R</i> is the molar gas constant (SI units, J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>), and <i>T</i> is the thermodynamic temperature (K). When the pressure is measured in Pa and the volume in m<sup>3</sup>, then <i>R</i> equals 8.3144 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. With pressure in atm and volume in cm<sup>3</sup>, <i>R</i> = 82.057 cm<sup>3</sup> atm<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. For non-ideal gases, the equation of state is a more complex function of <i>p</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>T</i>. For most common gases encountered in atmospheric chemistry, the ideal gas law is followed well at low pressures and up to pressures somewhat above one atm. With compounds such as NO<sub>2</sub> and formic acid (HCO<sub>2</sub>H) which dimerize easily [forming N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and (HCO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>, respectively&#93;, measured pressures must be corrected using the equilibrium constants for these dimerizations to estimate the amount of the monomer and dimer species present. <B>GB</B>: A pure gaseous substance B is treated as an ideal gas when the approximation <i>f</i><sub>B</sub><sup>*</sup>&#183;= <i>p</i> is used (where <i>f</i><sub>B</sub><sup>*</sup> is the fugacity of B and <i>p</i> its pressure.)
Illuminance:: Photometric counterpart of irradiance (not of radiance or intensity). Common units are footcandle, lumens cm<sup>-2</sup>, lumens m<sup>-2</sup>. Not a radiometric quantity, but a photometric quantity. See <i>luminance</i>.
Immission:: A Germanic term, pronounced in English, eye-mission; the transfer of pollutants from the atmosphere to a receptor; for example, pollutants retained by the lungs. It does not have the same meaning as ground level concentration, but is the opposite in meaning to emission. This term has not been used commonly in the English language.
Immission dose:: The integral of the immission flow into the receptor over the exposure period.
Immission flux:: The immission rate divided by the unit surface area of the receptor. 
Immission rate:: The mass (or other physical quantity) of pollutant transferring per unit time into a receptor.
Impaction:: A forcible contact of particles of matter with a surface.
Cascade impactor:: An instrument used for the classification of aerosols according to size and for possible subsequent chemical analysis. Air is drawn through a series of orifices of decreasing size; the air flow is normal to collecting surfaces on which aerosols are collected by inertial impaction. The particles, separated stepwise by their momentum differences into a number of size ranges, are collected simultaneously.
Impingement:: Equivalent to <i>impaction</i>; often refers to impaction on a liquid surface.
Impinger:: A sampling instrument employing impingement for the collection of particulate matter. Common types are: a) the midget impinger employing impingement in 1-10 cm<sup>3</sup> water, b) the standard impinger employing impingement in 75 cm<sup>3</sup> water, and c) dry impingers. Impingers are also suitable for sampling certain gases and vapours.
Incinerator:: Equipment in which solid, liquid, or gaseous combustible wastes are ignited and burned. Types include flue-fed and multiple-chamber incinerators with several stages of combustion.
Individual perception threshold (IPT):: A term used in odor testing which signifies the lowest concentration of a particular species at which a subject indicates both an initial positive and repeated response.
Inert gas:: A non-reactive gas under particular conditions. For example nitrogen at ordinary temperatures, and the noble gases (helium, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are unreactive toward most species.
Inertial separator:: Any dry type collector which utilizes the relatively greater inertia of particles to effect their removal from a gas stream; e.g., cyclonic and impingement separators, gravity settling chambers, and high-velocity gas reversal chambers.
Infrared gas analyser:: Instruments with various degrees of sophistication are employed to monitor certain species with characteristic infrared absorption bands. E.g., relatively simple systems are employed to detect carbon monoxide (CO) in air; these are built with matching cells, one containing a reference CO sample with the air to be tested in the other. Filtered infrared light which lies largely within the CO absorption region is passed through both cells. In one use of the instrument, the pressure difference which results from the preferential heating of the cell with the higher CO concentration is measured. The signal can be calibrated to yield the CO concentration. Sophisticated infrared systems involving Fourier transform spectrometers or infrared laser diodes are employed to detect particular molecular species of interest in atmospheric chemistry (NO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>O, CO, HNO<sub>3</sub>, etc.) and to study their reactions in the real atmosphere or in simulated atmospheres in the laboratory. Long path lengths for the infrared beam are required to detect the small concentrations of most species.
Instrumental Instability:: Change which takes place in instrument reading over a stated period of unattended operation for a given value of the air quality characteristic. It can be characterized by the variation with time of its mean, specifying the drift, and by the dispersion. <i>Span instability</i> is the change which takes place in instrument span over a stated period of unattended operation. <i>Zero instability</i> is the change in instrument reading in response to a zero sample over a stated period of unattended operation.
Instantaneous sampling:: Obtaining a sample of the atmosphere in a period which is short compared with the duration of the sampling exercise. Such samples are often called grab samples, a term nor recommended. These are useful for the analysis of hydrocarbons and other complicated mixtures of trace gases which are relatively stable in a stainless steel canister or tank and can be transported back to the laboratory for chromatographic or other analysis which cannot be done satisfactorily in the field. The use of plastic bags (constructed of Mylar, FEP Teflon, Tedlar (PVC) or other films) to collect instantaneous samples and to store them for analysis is not recommended. It is very difficult to eliminate pinholes, the reproducibility of heat seals used in constructing the bags is not easy to achieve, gases can permeate through the bag walls, and impurities can be introduced through off-gassing of the bag walls.
Instrument reading:: Output signal of a measuring system obtained as a response related to the concentration or the value of the air quality characteristic.
Spectral intensity:: Radiant power per unit solid angle (W sr<sup>-1</sup>). With the adjective <i>spectral</i>, differentiation with respect to wavelength is also implied (W sr<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>). Unfortunately, several other conflicting definitions of intensity exist, including the power per unit area, and the power per unit solid angle and projected area. The latter definition is common in atmospheric radiative transfer literature, and is synonymous with <i>radiance</i>. In spectroscopic literature and in Beer-Lambert law studies, the term <i>intensity</i> is used to describe the radiant power of collimated light entering a detector; this definition is synonymous with <i>irradiance</i>. These ambiguous uses of intensity are so common as to be unavoidable, but unless the definition given above is intended, it is best to use the word only in a generic sense to signify the amount of light, and then to use the appropriate radiative quantity for numerical calculations. <B>GB</B>: The energy per unit time entering a small sphere in a time interval divided by the area of the great circle of the sphere and the time interval. For monodirectional radiation, this reduces to the energy flux density.<i>Interferant</i> (<B>GB</B>: <i>interferent</i>): In measuring the concentration of a constituent of an air sample; any other component that affects the instrument reading. <B>GB</B>: A concomitant causing an interference in a sample.

Inversion height:: The height above ground level at which there is change in sign of the normal temperature lapse rate, d<i>T</i>/d<i>z</i> (the rate of change of the temperature with height). Several temperature inversions may be present in the air over a given site at different altitudes as result of various meteorological factors.
Temperature Inversion:: A departure &#183;from the normal decrease of temperature with increasing altitude. A temperature inversion may be produced, for example, by the movement of a warm air mass over a cool one. Intense surface inversions may form over the land during nights with clear skies and low winds due to the radiative loss of heat from the surface of the earth. The temperature increases as a function of height in this case. Poor mixing of the pollutants generally occurs below the inversion, since the normal convective process which drive the warmer and lighter air at ground level to higher altitudes is interrupted as the rising air parcels encounter the warmer air above. Temperature inversions near the surface are particularly effective in trapping ground level emissions.
Ion:: (<B>GB</B>) An atomic or molecular particle having a net electric charge.
Ionization energy:: In mass spectrometry, the minimum electron energy necessary for the production of the molecule ion. The term <i>ionization energy</i> is preferred.
Ionization potential:: In mass spectrometry, the minimum electron energy necessary for the production of the molecule ion. The term <i>ionization energy</i> is preferred.
Spectral irradiance:: The incident radiant power per unit projected area of a specified receiving surface (W cm<sup>-2</sup>). With the adjective <i>spectral</i>, differentiation with respect to wavelength is also implied (W cm<sup>-2</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup>). It may be calculated from the radiance (<i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;)) by the cosine-weighted integral over all directions using the relation:<i>E</i>(&#108;) = º&#102;º&#113; <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;,&#102;) cos&#102; sin&#102; d&#102; d&#113;This is the radiometric quantity measured with a flat-plate radiometer.
Isobar:: Lines on a plot joining points of equal barometric pressure in the atmosphere.
Isokinetic line:: A line in a given surface connecting points with equal wind speed; also called <i>isotach</i> or <i>isovel</i>.
Isokinetic sampling:: A technique for collecting airborne particulate in which the sampling device has a collection efficiency of unity for all sizes of particles in sampled air, regardless of wind velocity and direction of the instrument. The air stream entering the collector has a velocity (speed and direction) equal to that of the air in the gas stream just ahead of the sampling port of the collector.
Isotherm:: Lines joining points of equal temperature in the atmosphere.
Isotope pattern::In mass spectrometry, set of peaks related to ions with the same chemical formula but containing different isotopes; e.g., the 16 and 17 mass/charge peaks in a CH<sub>4</sub> sample arising from <sup>12</sup>CH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ions.	
Isotropic:: A quantity which is independent of direction. <i>Anisotropic</i> and <i>nonisotropic</i> refer to quantities which are direction dependent.	
j-values:: An effective first order rate constant for a photochemical reaction (photodecomposition, etc.) of light-absorbing impurities in the atmosphere. It is given by the following relation for the hypothetical photodecomposition of a molecule <i>X</i> into products <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> in reaction (I) or by an alternative reactive channel (II) forming <i>C</i> + <i>D</i>:<i>X</i> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; <i>A</i> + <i>B</i>&#9;(I)<i>X</i> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; <i>C</i> + <i>D</i>&#9;(II)<i>j</i><sub>I</sub> = º &#115;(&#108;) &#102;<sub>I</sub>(&#108;) <i>S</i>(&#108;) d&#108;<i>j</i><sub>II</sub> = º &#115;(&#108;) &#102;<sub>II</sub>(&#108;) <i>S</i>(&#108;) d&#108;where &#115;(&#108;), is the absorption cross section of the <i>X</i> species at wave length &#108;, &#102;<sub>I</sub>(&#108;) and &#102;<sub>II</sub>(&#108;) are the primary quantum yields of the reactions (I) and (II), respectively, <i>S</i>(&#108;) is the actinic flux (or spheradiance). Each quantity is that which applies for the small wavelength interval from &#108; to &#108; + d&#108;, and the integral is over all wavelengths for which the &#115;&#102;S product is non-zero. The rates of generation of <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> at the particular point in the atmosphere for which <i>j</i><sub>I</sub> and <i>j</i><sub>II</sub> apply are given by: d[<i>A</i>]/d<i>t</i> = <i>j</i><sub>I</sub>[<i>X</i>]; d[<i>D</i>]/d<i>t</i> = <i>j</i><sub>II</sub>[<i>X</i>]. In practice the resolution of the available data is often not great enough to allow the integration, and a summation of average quantities over some small wavelength interval is then employed (similar function for <i>j</i><sub>II</sub>)where the summation is over all wavelength intervals for which the product of terms is non-zero. <i>j</i>-values are usually given in units of s<sup>-1</sup> or min<sup>-1</sup>. The small <i>j</i> is preferred to the capital <i>J</i> in representing <i>j</i>-values since <i>j</i> is equivalent to the first order rate coefficient for which a small <i>k</i> is used (not a large <i>K</i> which is reserved for equilibrium constants).	????
Ketones:: A class of organic compounds of general formula R(C=O)R', where R and R' are organic groups such as CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc. Ketones are products of hydrocarbon oxidation. The simplest ketones are: acetone (propanone, CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>4</sub>), 2-butanone (or methyl ethyl ketone, CH<sub>3</sub>COC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), 3-pentanone (or diethyl ketone, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>). Ketones absorb sunlight (&#108; &lt; 320 nm) to form radicals by photodecomposition and react with HO-radicals in the atmosphere.	::# chem tagger
Kinetics:: The study of the rates at which reactions occur, the influence of conditions (such as temperature, concentration of reactants, surface/volume ratio, etc.) on these rates, and the determination of rate coefficients.	
Lachrymator:: A substance which produces a flow of tears in a person or animal (e.g., acetyl chloride, acrylaldehyde, etc.).	
Lapse rate:: The variation of an atmospheric variable with height; unless otherwise stated the variable is temperature.	
Temperature lapse rate:: The rate of change of temperature with altitude (d<i>T</i>/d<i>z</i>). The rate of temperature decrease with increase in altitude which is expected to occur in an unperturbed dry air mass is 9.8 x 10<sup>-3</sup> &#176;C m<sup>-1</sup>. This is called the <i>dry adiabatic lapse rate</i>. The lapse rate is taken as positive when temperature decreases with increasing height. For air saturated with H<sub>2</sub>O, the lapse rate is less because of the release of the latent heat of water as it condenses. The average tropospheric lapse rate is about 6.5 x 10<sup>-3</sup> &#176;C m<sup>-1</sup>. The lapse rate has a negative value within an inversion layer.	
LIDAR:: An acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. It is a real time remote sensing technique for the determination of aerosol and trace gas concentrations in air by measurement of scattered laser radiation.	
Lifetime:: The period of time (&#116;) required for the decay of a given species of initial concentration [A]<sub>o</sub> to [A]<sub>o</sub>/e (e = 2.7183). Often applied to species which decay by first order processes in which case &#116; = 1/<i>k</i>, where <i>k</i> is the first order rate coefficient for the reaction, A --&gt; Products. It is also applied to species which undergo decay by processes which may be second order as well. E.g., if species A is removed by HO-radical reaction and photodecomposition in the atmosphere, HO + A --&gt; Products (1); A + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; Products (2), then the lifetime of A is given by: &#116; = 1/(<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>[HO] + <i>j</i><sub>2</sub>), where <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> is the second order rate coefficient for reaction (1), [HO] is the HO radical concentration, and <i>j</i><sub>2</sub> is the first order rate coefficient (<i>j</i>-value) for reaction (2) for a particular time and place. Sometimes lifetimes are calculated as average lifetimes (global averages over the year, averages for a given latitude, season, etc.) in the atmosphere; in this case average values of <i>k</i><sub>1&#91;</sub>HO], <i>j</i><sub>2</sub>, and other loss terms are used. The half-life (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>) of species A is related to the lifetime by the time required for decay of the species from a concentration of <i>C</i><sub>A</sub> to <i>C</i><sub>A</sub>/2 and is related to &#116; by <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = (ln2)&#116;.	
Light scattering:: The redirection of a light beam due to interactions with molecules (Rayleigh and Raman scattering) and aerosols (Mie scattering). Scattered light received at any point in the atmosphere (sometimes called sky radiation) is a very important component of the total radiation received from the sun; it is dependent on the solar zenith angle, elevation, aerosol concentration, etc. <B>GB</B>: The deflection of a light beam by discrete variation in refractive index due to the presence of particles or by spatial refractive index fluctuations. For <i>elastic scattering</i> there is no wavelength shift. For <i>inelastic scattering</i> there are wavelength shifts due to molecular transitions (Raman effect, fluorescence) and for <i>quasielastic scattering</i> there are wavelength shifts and line broadening due to time dependent processes. In <i>single scattering</i> there is only one scattering encounter whereas in <i>multiple scattering</i> there is successive rescattering of the radiation within the scattering medium.	
#Limiting condition of operation:: Range of physical and operational parameters in which the method meets given values of performance characteristics with 95% probability.	
Linear range:: Concentration range over which the intensity of the signal obtained is directly proportional to the concentration of the species producing the signal.	
Lithometeor:: A particle of dry substance in the atmosphere, as contrasted to a hydrometeor.	
Lithosphere:: The crust of the earth, usually thought of as discrete from and in contact with the hydrosphere and the atmosphere.	
Log-normal distribution:: A distribution function <i>F</i>(<i>y</i>), in which the logarithm of a quantity is normally distributed, i.e., <i>F</i>(<i>y</i>) = <i>f</i><sub>gauss</sub>(ln <i>y</i>) where <i>f</i><sub>gauss</sub>(<i>x</i>) is a Gaussian distribution. The size distribution of atmospheric aerosols are often described using this distribution function, although the term also applies to gaseous pollutants.	
Luminance:: Photometric counterpart of radiance, producing the visual sensation called brightness. Typical units are: candela m<sup>-2</sup> (nit), candela cm<sup>-2</sup> (stilb), foot lambert (2.426 nit). As with all photometric quantities, luminance does not refer to a specific wavelength, but applies to light emitted by a standard source (formerly a "standard international candle", now a blackbody radiator emitting at the temperature of solidifying platinum, 2042 K). Conversion from photometric units to radiometric units (e.g., J s<sup>-1</sup>) requires convolution over wavelength of the relative spectral response of the human eye (photopic response tables).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
Luminescence:: The emission of light by a molecule or ion which is at temperatures below those required for incandescence. Luminescence can originate from electronically excited states of molecules or ions. If the excited state is short lived, as is the case for excited singlet to ground state singlet electronic transitions, the emission follows excitation within a short time period (about 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup> s commonly) and is called <i>fluorescence</i>. The fluorescence from the polycyclic aromatic compounds provides a useful means of identification and quantification of these species. If the emitting state undergoes a spectroscopically forbidden transition, for example, an excited triplet to ground state singlet electronic transition, then the emission may be delayed (greater than about 10<sup>-3</sup> s) following excitation; this emission is called <i>phosphorescence</i>. Some molecules (e.g., butanedione) give strong phosphorescence which is useful in identification. <i>Chemiluminescenc</i>e is the emission which results from an excited state formed in a chemical reaction which does not involve light absorption; for example, luminol oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generates chemiluminescence which can be used for analytical purposes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
Macrometeorology:: Study of the largest-scale aspects of the atmosphere, e.g., general global circulation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
Manometer:: An instrument for measuring pressure differences. Usually a liquid such as mercury, water, or some low vapour pressure liquid of the desired density is placed in a U-tube. One end of the tube is evacuated and the other is open to the system in which the pressure is to be measured. Differences between the lengths of the liquid columns in the arms (coupled with a knowledge of the density of the liquid) are used to monitor the pressure changes. See also <i>pressure gauges</i>.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
Mass balance:: Summation of the masses of a given element in its various compounds before and after reaction (changes) in the atmosphere; provides a test of the completeness of the accounting of the various reaction paths for this element which can be had through the compounds which have been analysed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
Mass spectrometer:: An instrument used in gas analysis which operates by ionising gaseous atoms or molecules, generally, with electrons of relatively low energy. The parent ions and ion fragments produced are accelerated electrically into a mass separator (involving electric and magnetic fields) which separates ions of specific mass to charge ratio. In a <i>quadrupole mass spectrometer</i> the mass separator involves four parallel rods between which a fixed direct current voltage is applied together with a superimposed radiofrequency voltage. <i>Chemical ionization mass spectrometry</i> involves the creation of reagent ions by transfer of electrons or protons from an initial ion to a reagent molecule. In <i>time-of-flight mass spectrometry</i>, ions produced in an ionizing pulse are accelerated by a given voltage toward a receiver electrode, and the ions of the different mass-to-charge ratios are resolved by their different arrival times at the detector.

Mixing height:: The height to which significant mixing of added pollutants occurs within the atmosphere. In reference to stack gases, it is considered the height at which stack effluent begins mixing with the atmosphere as it leaves the stack.	
Mixing ratio:: In meteorology, the dimensionless ratio of the mass of a substance (such as water vapour) in an air parcel to the mass of the remaining substances in the air parcel. For trace substances, this is approximated by the ratio of the mass of the substance to the mass of air. However, in the case of water vapour the mass of dry air is used. In atmospheric chemistry, mixing ratios (molecular, molar, by volume, as well as by weight) are used to describe relative concentrations of atmospheric trace gases and impurities; see <i>concentration</i>.

NO<sub>3</sub> absorbs sunlight strongly and is photodissociated rapidly during the day. Its concentration rises at sundown, and it is most readily detected in the atmosphere at night through its strong absorption bands in the 620-660 nm region.	::# chem tagger
Nitrous acid (HONO):: A weak acid formed in the troposphere. During the day HONO is formed by the reaction, HO + NO --&gt; HONO, but it is rapidly photodecomposed in sunlight (HONO + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; HO + NO) so that only a very small concentration of HONO is present at that time.

Possible sources include homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions such as: HO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; HONO + O<sub>2</sub>; or 2NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O --&gt; HONO + HNO<sub>3</sub>.Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)	::# chem tagger

O-Atoms:: Oxygen atoms occur in the atmosphere in two different electronic states: a) O(<sup>3</sup>P), ground state oxygen atoms which are formed largely from NO<sub>2</sub> photodecomposition for &#108; &lt; 420 nm, O<sub>3</sub> photodecomposition at &#108; &gt; 310 nm, and quenching of O(<sup>1</sup>D) atoms by collision with O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. Its major fate in the atmosphere is its reaction with O<sub>2</sub> to form O<sub>3</sub>: O + O<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M. b) O(<sup>1</sup>D), oxygen atoms in the first electronically excited state, are formed in O<sub>3</sub> photolysis at &#108; &lt; 310 nm. This species is the major source of HO-radicals in the atmosphere through its reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O: O(<sup>1</sup>D) + H<sub>2</sub>O --&gt; 2HO. In the upper atmosphere highly excited O(<sup>1</sup>S) atoms also are generated.	
Odour threshold:: The concentration of a compound which produces an odor which is detectable by a human being (nose). For certain compounds this threshold is very low (e.g., 1 part in 10<sup>9</sup> for certain sulfides).	
Odor threshold:: The concentration of a compound which produces an odor which is detectable by a human being (nose). For certain compounds this threshold is very low (e.g., 1 part in 10<sup>9</sup> for certain sulfides).	
Open burning:: The occasional burning of outdoor stores of lumber, sawdust, scrapped cars, tires, textiles, open dumps, etc.	
Open hearth furnace:: Reverberatory furnace, containing a basin-shaped hearth, for melting and refining suitable types of pig iron, iron ore, and scrap for steel production.

 (RO<sub>2</sub>):: A radical formed in the reaction sequence which follows HO-radical attack on hydrocarbons (RH) and their oxidation products: HO + RH --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O + R; R + O<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RO<sub>2</sub>; typical alkylperoxyl radicals are: CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <i>n</i>-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. In an NO<sub>x</sub>-containing air mass, these radicals react to oxidize NO to NO<sub>2</sub> (RO<sub>2</sub> + NO --&gt; RO + NO<sub>2</sub>) as part of the chain reaction which leads to ozone generation in the troposphere.	
Organylperoxyl radical:: A radical formed in the reaction sequence which follows HO-radical attack on hydrocarbons (RH) and their oxidation products: HO + RH --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O + R; R + O<sub>2</sub> --&gt; RO<sub>2</sub>; typical alkylperoxyl radicals are: CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <i>n</i>-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. In an NO<sub>x</sub>-containing air mass, these radicals react to oxidize NO to NO<sub>2</sub> (RO<sub>2</sub> + NO --&gt; RO + NO<sub>2</sub>) as part of the chain reaction which leads to ozone generation in the troposphere.	
Overfire:: High-velocity air jets issuing from nozzles in a furnace enclosure to provide turbulence and oxygen to aid combustion, or to provide cooling air; <i>overfire</i> air is also known as <i>secondary</i> air.	
Oxidant::With reference to atmospheric chemistry, a very qualitative term which includes any and all trace gases which have a greater oxidation potential than oxygen (for example, ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, NO<sub>3</sub>, etc.). It is recommended that alternative, more definitive terms be used which define the specific oxidant of interest whenever possible.	
Oxidation:: The chemical process by which the oxidation state of an atom in a element, ion, or compound is increased.	
Ooxidation number:: A measure of the degree of oxidation of an atom in a substance. It is defined as the charge an atom might be imagined to have when electrons are counted according to an agreed-upon set of rules: 1) The oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is zero; 2) for a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion; 3) Hydrogen has an oxidation state of 1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of &#151;2 when they are present in most compounds. (Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an oxidation state of &#151;1 in hydrides of active metals, e.g., LiH, and oxygen has an oxidation state of &#151;1 in peroxides, e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>); 4) the algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion. For example, the oxidation states of sulfur in H<sub>2</sub>S, S<sub>8</sub> (elementary sulfur), SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are, respectively: &#151;2, 0, +4, +6, and +6. The higher the oxidation state of a given atom, the greater is its degree of oxidation; the lower the oxidation state, the greater is its degree of reduction. See also <B>GB</B>.

The higher the oxidation state of a given atom, the greater is its degree of oxidation; the lower the oxidation state, the greater is its degree of reduction. See also <B>GB</B>.	
Oxidized species:: In chemistry, a term used to characterize the degree of oxidation (or reduction) in atoms, molecules, and ions. An atom in a molecule or an ion which has a high oxidation state. An element or atom in a compound can be oxidized by reaction with oxygen, while it can be reduced by reaction with hydrogen. An oxidized species may be formed also through the loss of electrons (either to the positive electrode in a cell, or through transfer to another atom or group of atoms). For example, the sulfur in H<sub>2</sub>S is reduced sulfur relative to elementary sulfur, while in SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> are oxidized. Metallic iron (Fe) is a reduced state of iron, while the Fe<sup>+2</sup> ion (ferrous ion) and Fe<sup>+3</sup> ion (ferric ion) are oxidized states of iron. Fe<sup>+3</sup> is in a higher oxidation state than Fe<sup>+2</sup> which is in a higher oxidation state than Fe. See <i>oxidation state</i>.	
Oxygen, molecular (O<sub>2</sub>):: A reactive species which comprises about 21% by volume of the gases present in the earth's atmosphere. It is a necessary species for the existence of most forms of life on earth. It is a highly reactive gas which is capable of combining with most of the other elements. See also <i>ozone, O-atoms</i>.	::# chem tagger
Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>):: A highly reactive compound which occurs in the atmosphere. It is formed in the stratosphere through the photolysis of molecular oxygen at wavelengths less than 240 nm: (O<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; 2O; O + O<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M). The stratospheric ozone acts as a protective shield which filters the wavelengths of sunlight which enter the lower atmosphere to those longer than about 290 nm. Ozone is a common secondary pollutant which is formed in a polluted air mass through the action of sunlight on NO<sub>2</sub> (NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; O + NO; O + O<sub>2</sub> + M(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M). This is the most abundant of the oxidants formed in photochemical smog.	::# chem tagger
Ozone hole:: A region of the stratosphere over Antarctica in which a marked decrease in the concentration of ozone has been observed in the Antarctic spring in recent years. The origin of this phenomenon is not yet established, but several theories based on both physical (transport related) and chemical processes (involvement of the halocarbons and their products of oxidation) have been suggested. The latter explanation appears to be in better accord with recent findings.	
PAH:: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; see <i>hydrocarbon, aromatic</i>.	
Particle:: A small discrete mass of solid or liquid matter.	
Particle counter:: A device for measuring the number of suspended particles (in a certain size range) per volume unit of a gaseous or liquid medium.	
Particle size:: To describe the size of liquid or solid particles (aerosol) the average or equivalent diameter is used. For nonspherical particles collected in an impactor, for example, the aerodynamic diameter of a particle of arbitrary shape and density refers to the size of a spherical particle of unit density that would deposit on a given impactor surface.	
Particle size distribution:: The size of the liquid or solid particles in the atmosphere usually extends from &gt;0.01 to &lt;100 &#109;m in diameter. In the earth's atmosphere the distribution function which describes the number of particles as a function of diameter, mass, or surface area of the aerosol can be determined reasonably well with modern instrumentation.	
Particulate matter:: A general term used to describe airborne solid or liquid particles of all sizes. The term aerosol is recommended for general use in describing airborne particulate matter.

These devices containing certain condensable gases (e.g., NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) when operated at closely controlled temperatures can be used as primary standards calibrated in terms of the weight loss per unit time.
Peroxyl organic radical:: see <i>organylperoxyl radical</i>.
pH:: A measure of the acidity of aqueous solutions. As originally defined by S&oslash;renson in 1909, the quantity pH = -lg[H<sup>+</sup>]. However since activities of hydrogen ion (and not hydrogen ion concentrations) are measured by means of pH meters which employ an electrochemical cell (often a glass electrode), it is logical to define pH in terms of the activity of hydrogen ion (<i>a</i><sub>H+</sub>) in solution:pH = -lg(<i>a</i><sub>H+</sub>)The pH of pure water (25 &#176;C) = 7.0; acid solutions have values of pH &lt; 7 while basic solutions have pH &gt; 7. <B>GB</B>: The concept of pH is unique amongst physicochemical quantities in that, in terms of its (notational) definition given in the above equation, involving as it does a single ion activity, it is immeasurable. It is therefore defined operationally in terms of the operation or method used to measure it, see http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04524.html or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH.
Phase:: In chemistry, a physically distinct, homogeneous portion of a heterogeneous mixture.
Photochemical reaction:: A reaction involving an electronically excited state of a molecule or atom which can occur following light absorption of sufficient energy per quantum (usually ultraviolet or visible radiation). In electronically excited molecules one of several types of photochemical reaction may occur: photodecomposition into molecular fragments or radicals, photodecomposition into stable, smaller products, photoisomerization, intersystem crossing (a singlet to triplet state, etc.), internal energy conversion (e.g., excited singlet to vibrationally excited, singlet ground state), fluorescence, phosphorescence, electronic or vibrational energy quenching, etc.
Photochemical smog:: The resulting mix of ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, aldehydes and other oxidation products of the hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, aerosols, etc., which form in highly polluted urban atmospheres under conditions of stagnation and high sunlight intensity in cities such as Los Angeles, California. Most large cities in the world show some degree of photochemical smog generation today. Photochemical smog is a highly oxidizing atmosphere in contrast with the SO<sub>2</sub>-rich pollution and fogs which characterized many cities such as London, England, many years ago. The characteristics of photochemical smog also include eye-irritation, visibility reduction, damage to certain sensitive plants and trees, and possible pulmonary and other health-related problems in humans and animals.
Photochemistry:: The chemistry of excited electronic states of atoms and molecules formed by the absorption of light by an atom or molecule. The primary processes in photochemistry of a given compound are the various reaction channels of the electronically excited species. These can be molecular decomposition into stable molecules or radicals, molecular isomerization, fluorescence, phosphorescence, electronic quenching by collision, etc. The reactions of the molecular fragments which are formed photochemically, are correctly referred to as thermal reactions, in that they are analogous to the reactions induced following thermal decomposition at high temperatures. The term photochemistry is sometimes used incorrectly by atmospheric scientists to refer both the photochemical reactions of the electronically excited species as well as the purely thermal reactions of the atoms, free radicals and molecules which are present in the atmosphere.
Photolysis:: Although it means literally the cleavage of a bond by light, it has been used incorrectly to indicate the act of irradiating a substance with light. Specific terms such as <i>photodecomposition</i>, <i>photoisomerization</i>, <i>photodissaciation</i>, which describe the physical consequences of the irradiation are more descriptive and are recommended terms.
Photometry:: The measurement of light over wavelengths which produce visual sensation (approximately 380-780 nm). Thus photometric quantities do not refer to a specific wavelength but to the light emitted by a standard source (formerly a standard international candle, now a blackbody radiator emitting at the temperature of solidifying platinum, 2042 K). <i>Luminance</i> and <i>illuminance</i> are the photometric analogues of the radiometric quantities <i>radiance</i> and <i>irradiance</i>, respectively, but conversion from photometric units (e.g., lm cm<sup>-2</sup>) to radiometric units (e.g., J s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) requires convolution over wavelength of the spectral radiation with the relative spectral response of the human eye. The standard response is called the "spectral luminous efficiency of radiation", and is tabulated for daylight adapted vision in photopic response tables.
Photophoresis:: in aerosol physics, the motion of particles due to the influence of light. In many cases, this amounts to a special form of thermophoresis due to the heating of the particles by the light.
Photostationary state:: Highly reactive species in the atmosphere are often destroyed at a rate which is approximately equal to that at which they are formed. If the process of formation or destruction of such a species is initiated by light, then the reactive species is said to be in a photo-stationary state. The concentration of such species adjusts to changes in the actinic flux (time of day, cloud-cover, etc.) and other reactant concentrations. The system of ozone, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide in the sunlight-irradiated troposphere achieves a photostationary state when NO is the major reactant to destroy ozone; for these conditions the reactions are: NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; O(<sup>3</sup>P) + NO (1); O(<sup>3</sup>P) + O<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M (2); O<sub>3</sub> + NO --&gt; NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> (3). At the photostationary state the concentration of ozone is given by: [O<sub>3</sub>] Å ([NO<sub>2</sub>]/[NO](<i>j</i><sub>NO2</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>3</sub>), where <i>j</i><sub>NO2</sub> is the effective first order rate coefficient for reaction (1) for the given conditions of actinic flux and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> is the second order rate coefficient for reaction (3) at the appropriate temperature of the atmosphere. Deviations from the O<sub>3</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> photo-stationary state are expected in theory and are observed in the atmosphere when reaction (3) does not dominate the O<sub>3</sub> loss mechanisms, e.g., at low [NO].
Photosynthesis:: A metobolic process involving plants and some types of bacteria (e.g., Chromataceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Chlorobiaceae) in which light energy absorbed by chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments results in the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> followed by the formation of organic compounds. In plants the overall process involves the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O to carbohydrates (and other plant material) and the release of O<sub>2</sub>.
Phytotoxicant:: An agent which produces a toxic effect in vegetation.
Plant damage:: Damage to living plants by certain air pollutants (SO<sub>2</sub>, certain metal fluorides, O<sub>3</sub>, peroxyacetyl nitrate, nitrogen oxides, etc.) often is evident as leaf tissue collapse, chlorosis, and growth alteration.
Plume:: The gaseous and aerosol effluents which are emitted from a chimney and the volume of space which they occupy (often visible). The shape of the plume and the concentrations of pollutants in it at various points along the path of the plume are sensitive functions of the meteorology, local topography, and the chemistry which occurs in the plume. Urban plumes are observed over many urban areas and downwind of these areas in which a combination of man sources of pollution are concentrated.
Polycyclic compounds:: Compounds of a structure containing more than one ring (cyclic series of covalent bonds); see also <i>polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons</i>. Atoms of elements other than carbon and hydrogen may be present in these ring structures (nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, etc.).
Potential temperature:: The temperature that a dry air parcel would have if lowered or raised adiabatically to level of 1000 mbar pressure (or other arbitrary standard pressure).
Potentiometer:: a) In electronics, a potentiometer is a sensitive voltage measuring device based on a null technique which provides infinite impedance at null; b) in chemistry, potentiometric methods involve the measurement with a potentiometer of voltage generated in a cell. A high impedance digital voltmeter is often used today as a convenient alternative to a potentiometer.
Precipitation::In chemistry, the sedimentation of a solid material from a liquid solution in which the material is present in amounts greater than its solubility in the liquid.
electrostatic precipitation:: Separation of particles or droplets suspended in a gas or air. A large potential difference (12 to 30 kV dc) is required between the spaced electrodes in the precipitator. The charged panicles are attracted to an electrode of opposite charge and collected.
Precipitation::in meteorology, rain, snowfall, hail, etc,
Precision:: The closeness of agreement between the results obtained by applying a given experimental procedure several times under prescribed conditions. The smaller the random part of the experimental errors which affect the results, the more precise is the method. A term not to be confused with <i>accuracy</i> which is a measure of the agreement between the true value and the measured value.
Precursor:: A chemical compound which is released into the atmosphere, undergoes chemical change, and leads to a new (secondary) pollutant, is called a precursor of that species.
Preexponential factor:: The term <i>A</i> which appears in the Arrhenius form of the rate coefficient expression, <i>k</i> = <i>A</i>e<sup>-Ea/RT</sup>; see <i>rate coefficient</i>.
Pressure gauge:: The difference in pressure existing within a system and that of the atmosphere. Zero gauge pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
Pressure gauges:: Devices for measuring the pressure in a system: <i>a) Bourdon tube gauge</i>: A device in which the responsive element is a blind, curved elastic tube, oval in cross section and open at one end to the systems of which the pressure is to be measured. The body of the gauge is at atmospheric or some other controlled pressure. Increasing pressure within the gauge causes the radius of curvature to increase, and this motion drives an indicator. <i>b) Capacitance gauge</i>: A device in which a metal coated diaphragm serves as one plate of a capacitor. A reference pressure is applied to one side of the diaphragm and the pressure to be measured is applied to the other. Changes in pressure, change the capacitance which is transformed to a pressure reading by the device. Such devices are highly sensitive and are available commercially for a wide range of pressures. <i>c) Dead weight piston gauge</i>: An absolute pressure measuring device, usually used for calibration of other types of pressure measuring devices. It consists of a hydraulic system equipped with a cylinder and a piston of accurately known area. Pressure is applied to the hydraulic system and weights are added externally to the piston until the external force exerted by the piston equals the force exerted by the hydraulic system. The pressure exerted by the hydraulic system can be calculated from the combined weight of the piston and the added weights, and the area of the piston.
Static pressure:: The pressure of a fluid at rest, or in motion exerted perpendicularly to the direction of flow.
Primary mixture:: A mixture obtained directly from two or more components intended for the preparation of more dilute calibration mixtures (called secondary or tertiary mixtures).
Primary pollutant:: A pollutant emitted directly into the air from identifiable sources (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>, NO, hydrocarbons, etc.). Secondary pollutants, such as ozone, are generated within the atmosphere through chemical changes which occur in primary pollutants.
Probe:: A device, commonly in the form of a tube, used for sampling or measurement inside a duct, stack, volcano, vent, etc.
Psychrometry:: The use of a wet-and-dry-bulb thermometer for measurement of atmospheric humidity.
Quality assurance:: The guarantee that the quality of a product (analytical data set, etc.) is actually what is claimed on the basis of the quality control applied in creating that product. Quality assurance is not synonymous with quality control. Quality assurance is meant to protect against failures of quality control.
Quality control:: The maintenance and statement of the quality of a product (data set, etc.) specifically that it meets or exceeds some minimum standard based on known, testable criteria.
Quantum of light:: A photon or "particle" of light; this has an energy given by <i>E</i> = <i>hc/&#108;</i> where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant, <i>c</i> the velocity of light, and &#108; the wavelength of light.
Quantum yield:: a) For primary processes this is the fraction of electronically excited molecules which decompose, isomerize, fluoresce, or react by some other specific pathway. If the excited molecule of <i>X</i> decomposes by reaction (I), <i>X</i> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> (I), then the quantum yield of this process is symbolized by &#102;<sub>I</sub>. If there are n different primary processes in which the excited state is involved, then the sum of the different process is equl to 1. b) For secondary products formed in the thermal reactions which follow the primary photochemical steps, the quantum yield of any stable product (<i>C</i>) is defined as the number of molecules of <i>C</i> formed in the system during a given short time period divided by the number of light quanta absorbed by <i>X</i> in the system during this time period. This quantum yield may be any number. It is often symbolized using a capital phi (e.g., &#70;<sub>C</sub>) to distinguish it from the primary quantum yield; thus the quantum yield of hydrogen chloride (&#70;<sub>HCl</sub>) can be as high as 10<sup>6</sup> in irradiated mixtures of Cl<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> where chain reactions are important; see chain reaction. <B>GB</B>: The number of moles transformed in a specified process, physically (e.g., by emission of photons) or chemically, per mole of photons absorbed by the system.
Radiance:: The radiance, <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;<i>,&#102;</i>) is defined as <i>L</i>(&#108;,&#113;<i>,&#102;</i>) = d<i>Q</i>/(cos&#113; d<i>s</i> d&#119; d<i>t</i> d&#108;), where d<i>Q</i> is the radiant (light) energy in the wavelength interval &#108; to &#108; + d&#108; which is transported across a particular surface element of area d<i>s</i>, in time d<i>t</i>, originating from a solid angle d&#119; which is at an angle &#113; to the surface normal. Thus, the radiance specifies the energy emanating from an extended source, measured per unit time, unit solid angle, unit wavelength, and unit area of a surface perpendicular to the direction of incidence. In contrast to the actinic flux and the irradiance, the radiance has complete information about the direction of incidence of the light. The adjective "spectral" is often used with "radiance" to emphasize its wavelength dependence. The term "intensity" is often used instead of "radiance".
free radical:: A reactive atom or a fragment of a stable molecule which contains an odd number of bonding electrons. These reactive species have very short lifetimes in the lower atmosphere and low concentrations, although they are responsible for much of the chemical transformations in the atmosphere. Typical radical species encountered in atmospheric chemistry are: HO, HO<sub>2</sub>, Cl, ClO, NO<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>O,, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. The concentrations show strong diurnal variations. NO and NO<sub>2</sub> are technically radicals as well (since they have an odd-number of bonding electrons), but they do not exhibit the high reactivity normally associated with typical radicals. Some chemists (from Great Britain and elsewhere) follow a practice of coupling with the formula of a radical, a dot placed near the atom in the radical which is judged to have the highest probability for the location of the odd electron. Thus the <i>n</i>-propyl and isopropyl radicals may be written as CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#183;</sup> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sup>&#183;</sup>, respectively. Although this practice is not followed today by many of the atmospheric scientists, its use has some value in that it allows a rapid recognition of a radical species and of its reactive site. <i>Biradicals</i> contain two unpaired electrons, e.g., O(<sup>3</sup>P), CH<sub>2</sub>(triplet), CH<sub>2</sub>OO (Criegee intermediate), O<sub>2</sub>(ground state) etc. <i>Radical ions</i> are charged radicals (most common in solution phase reactions). <B>GB</B>: At least in the context of physical organic chemistry, it seems desirable to cease using the adjective "free" in the general name of this type of <i>chemical species</i> and molecular entity, so that the term free radical may in future be restricted to those radicals which do not form parts of <i>radical pairs</i>.
biradical::<i>Biradicals</i> contain two unpaired electrons, e.g., O(<sup>3</sup>P), CH<sub>2</sub>(triplet), CH<sub>2</sub>OO (Criegee intermediate), O<sub>2</sub>(ground state) etc.

radical ions::<i>Radical ions</i> are charged radicals (most common in solution phase reactions). 
Radiometry:: The measurement of quantities associated with radiant energy. The quantities may also describe the variation of the energy with respect to other variables such as wavelength, time, position, direction (solid angle), area normal to the light, or projected area of emitting or receiving surfaces. For example, see <i>intensity: radiance, irradiance</i>. If the light is monochromatic, it is sometimes convenient to replace the radiant energy by the corresponding number of photons (or quanta) which is obtained by dividing the energy by <i>hc/&#108;</i> where it is the Planck constant, <i>c</i> the velocity of light, and &#108; the wavelength of the light.
Radiosonde:: A miniature radio transmitter with instruments in a package that is carried aloft (e.g., by an unmanned balloon) for broadcasting every few seconds by means of precise tone signals or other suitable method, the humidity, temperature, pressure, or other parameter.
Rain out:: The mechanism by which small particles in the clouds are removed by the formation of rain-drops; this is a different mechanism from <i>wash out</i> which is a process which occurs below cloud level. Both the terms rain out and <i>wash out</i> have not always been used in accordance with these definitions. For clarity they should be replaced by the term, <i>in-cloud scavenging</i> and <i>below-cloud scavenging</i>, respectively.
Rate coefficient:: A coefficient (sometimes referred to as a <i>rate constant</i>) that appears in a rate equation which relates the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentrations of reactants: first order rate coefficient, <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> in the relation, -d[A]/d<i>t</i> = [A]<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, where [A] is the concentration of species A. Second order rate coefficient, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> in the relation, -d[A]/d<i>t</i> = [A][B]<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>. Third order rate coefficient, <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> in the relation, -d[A]/d<i>t</i> = [A][B][C]<i>k</i><sub>3</sub>; A, B, and C represent reactant molecules, and A, B, and C may be the same or different molecules. Many reactions which involve the association of two radicals (e.g., HO + NO<sub>2</sub> + M(N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) --&gt; HONO<sub>2</sub> + M) have second order rate coefficients which are pressure dependent and show a transition between third order at low pressures (direct dependence on [M]) to second order (independent of [M]) at high pressures. <i>Troe</i> expressions are often used to describe these. Some complex or composite reactions (e.g., chain reactions, heterogeneous reactions, solution phase reactions, etc.) have rate equations of a more complex form (fractional powers on the concentrations, ratios of concentrations, etc.). The term <i>rate coefficient</i> rather than <i>rate constant</i> is preferred since the k values are commonly dependent on temperature, total pressure, etc. Also in a composite reaction the measured rate coefficient may depend on a concentration term. Rate coefficients for photodissociation (called <i>j-values</i>) apply to photochemical reactions such as NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i> --&gt; O(<sup>3</sup>P) + NO; see <i>j-value</i>.
Rate constant:: see <i>rate coefficient</i>.
Rayleigh scattering:: The scattering of light by particles and molecules which are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. In the ideal case, the process is one of pure dipole and induced dipole interactions with the electric field of the light wave. The scattering cross section for light of wavelength &#108; is proportional to &#108;<sup>4</sup>.
elementary reaction:: A chemical reaction which describes a single step in a chemical reacting system. The formation of final products from initial reactants always takes place by one or more relatively simple steps (elementary reactions) in each of which the extent of transfer of atoms and molecular decomposition or rearrangement is very limited (a simple bond cleavage, etc.). <B>GB</B>: A reaction in which no reaction intermediates have been detected, or need to be postulated in order to describe the chemical reaction on a molecular scale. Until evidence to the contrary is discovered, an elementary reaction is assumed to occur in a single step and to pass through a single transition state.
Reaction mechanism:: A series of elementary reactions which describes the detailed chemical changes which occur in a chemically reacting system. <B>GB</B>: A detailed description of the pathway leading from the reactants to the products, including as complete a characterization as possible of the composition, structure and other properties of reaction intermediates and transition states. An acceptable mechanism of a specified reaction (and there may be a number of such alternative mechanisms not excluded by the evidence) must be consistent with the reaction stoichiometry, the rate law, and all other available experimental data, such as the stereochemical course of the reaction. Inferences concerning the electronic and nuclear motions which dynamically interconvert successive species along the reaction path, are often included in the description of a mechanism.
Recovery:: The percentage yield of added analyte after it has passed a sequence of operations constituting a particular analytical scheme.
Reduced species:: In chemistry, a term used to characterize the degree of reduction (or oxidation) in atoms, molecules, and ions. An atom in a molecule or an ion which has a low <i>oxidation state</i>. An element or atom in a compound can be reduced by the reaction of an element or compound with hydrogen, while it can be oxidized by reaction with oxygen. A reduced species can be formed also through the gain of electrons (either at the negative electrode in a ceil or through transfer from another atom, ion, or group of atoms in a chemical reaction). For example, the carbon atom in CH<sub>4</sub> and other hydrocarbons is in a reduced state, while the carbon in CO<sub>2</sub> is in an oxidized state. Similarly the sulfur atom in H<sub>2</sub>S is in a reduced state while that in sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is in an oxidized state. See <i>oxidation state</i>.
Reduction:: The chemical process by which the oxidation state of an atom in an element, ion, or compound is reduced.
Reference material:: A substance or mixture of substances, the composition of which is known within specified limits, and one or more of the properties of which is sufficiently well established to be used for the calibration of an apparatus, the assessment of a measuring method, or for assigning values to materials. Reference materials are available from national laboratories in many countries (e.g., National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S.A.; Community Bureau of Reference, U.K).
Reference procedure:: Agreed method for determining one or more air quality characteristics where it is not practical to produce a reference material; the result obtained is defined as the measure of the air quality characteristic. For example, a gas such as NO<sub>2</sub> may be somewhat unstable when stored in a tank at low mixing ratios, so that the use of a more stable NO standard mixture in N<sub>2</sub> may be oxidized to NO<sub>2</sub> by O<sub>3</sub> in a specified manner referred to as the NO<sub>2</sub> reference procedure.
Reflectance:: For a surface receiving radiation, ratio of the reflected radiant exitance to the incident irradiance. It may depend on wavelength and on direction of incidence, as indicated by the prefixes (e.g. spectral or directional reflectance)
Relative density:: The ratio of the density of a given substance to the density of a reference material at specified conditions of temperature and pressure; in the older literature this is called <i>specific gravity</i>.

Repeatability:: Qualitatively, the closeness of agreement between successive results obtained with the same method on identical test material, under the same conditions (same operator, same apparatus, same laboratory and short intervals of time). Quantitatively, the value below which the absolute difference between two single test results obtained in the above conditions may be expected to lie with a specified probability. In the absence of other indication, the probability is normally 95%.
Reproducibility:: Qualitatively, the closeness of agreement between individual results obtained with the same method on identical test material but under different conditions (different operators, different apparatus, different laboratories and/or different times). Quantitatively, the value below which the absolute difference between two single test results on identical material obtained by operators in different laboratories, using the standardized test method, may be expected to lie with a specified probability. In the absence of other indication, the probability is 95%.
Residence time::<i>a)</i> Instrumentation: The time required for air or reagent parcel to pass from the entrance to the exit of an instrument. Often this is approximated as the ratio of the interior volume of the device to the now rate.
Residence time:: <i>b) Atmospheric</i>: The average time a molecule or aerosol spends in the atmosphere after it is released or generated there. For compounds with well defined sources and emission rates, this is estimated by the ratio of the average global concentration of a substance to its production rate on a global scale. It is a function of not only the emission rates but the loss rates by chemical and physical removal processes.
Residual fuel/oil:: The liquid or semiliquid, high-boiling fraction of residue from the distillation of petroleum which is used as a fuel. After removal of the lower boiling fraction of crude oil, sold as petroleum gas, the somewhat higher boiling fraction becomes gasoline and diesel oil. A portion of the higher boiling fraction is "cracked" to yield additional gasoline. Still heavier oils become lubricants, Paraffin, asphalt, etc., are also extracted from the crude oil. It is the remaining residual oil, not economically usable for other industrial purposes, which is then sold as a relatively low cost fuel for burning.
Residual spectrum:: Set of peaks recorded in the absence of a sample and due either to small air leaks or to the presence of molecules desorbed from the walls of the introduction device or the source, or from the pump fluid.	
background spectrum::In mass spectrometry, a set of peaks recorded in the absence of a sample and due either to small air leaks or to the presence of molecules desorbed from the walls of the introduction device or the source, or from the pump fluid.

Resolution::In mass spectrometry, a number which expresses the possibility of separation of two ions of mass <i>m</i><sub>a</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>a</sub> + &#68;<i>m</i><sub>a</sub> in a mass spectrometer. It is given with the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the valley height to the height of two adjacent peaks, of equal height, considered in those conditions. For example: <i>m</i><sub>a</sub>/&#68;<i>m</i><sub>a</sub> = 100 at 10% valley.	
Resolution::In gas chromatography, a characteristic of the separation of two adjacent peaks.For equations describing peak resolution see: http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04465.html.	
Response time:: Time taken for an instrument to respond to a rapid change in value of the air quality characteristic. It consists of two major parts: <i>a) Lag time</i>, the time taken to reach 10% of the final change in instrument reading; <i>b) rise time (fall time)</i>, the time taken to pass from 10% to 90% of the final change in instrument reading. For instruments where transient oscillations occur in the approach to the final instrument reading, the rise time is considered to be the time taken for the oscillations to fall to less than 10% of the final change in instrument reading.	
Retention efficiency::In particle separation, the ratio of the quantity of particles retained by a separator to the quantity entering it (generally expressed as a percentage).	
Retention time::In gas chromatography, the time between the beginning of the injection of a sample and the moment where there is emergence of the peak maximum of a stated component. This time is quite reproducible with a given pure component when the flows, temperature, etc., are carefully controlled.	
Ringelmann chart:: A chart which has been used in air pollution evaluation for assigning the degree of blackness of smoke emanating from a source. The observer compares the shades of grey (white to black) with a series of shade diagrams formed by horizontal and vertical black grid lines on a white background. A corresponding number, the Ringelmann number, is then assigned to the describe the best match; numbers range from O (white) to 5 (black). This method of pollution evaluation, although relavent to the inforcement of legislation still in force in many countries, is not recommended for use today since more quantitative indicators of the efficiency of the combustion are now available.	
Rotometer:: A device, based on Stokes law, for measuring rate of fluid flow. it is a tapered vertical tube having a circular cross section in which a float moves in a vertical path to a height dependent upon the rate of fluid flow upward through the tube.	
Air sample:: A quantity of air (sometimes of known volume), which is assumed to be representative of the air mass under investigation, and which is examined for air quality characteristics.

Dichotomous Sampler:: Device for dividing a polydispersed aerosol particle population into two size fractions during sampling. The fractionation is based on the momentum differences of the particles which allow the larger particles to pass through a zone of stagnant gas.
Continuous Sampling:: Sampling, without interruptions, throughout an operation or for a predetermined time.
Cryogenic Sampling:: The collection of trace compounds from gaseous media by co-condensation with a major constituent (e.g., water vapour, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar) of the matrix.
Discontinuous Sampling:: Sampling in which the sample flow is periodically interrupted but not necessarily at equal time intervals.
Grab Sampling:: The taking of a sample (often in an evacuated bulb) in a very short time; preferred terms are <i>instantaneous sampling or spot sampling</i>.
Sequential Sampling:: Repetitive sampling from the same gas to be analysed or from several gases to be analysed successively.
Sampling train:: The complete assemblage of equipment necessary to sample atmospheres.
Sanitary land fill:: An engineered burial of refuse. The refuse is dumped into trenches and compacted by bulldozer, where, it is hoped, aerobic metabolism by microorganisms decomposes the organic matter to stable compounds (H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.). Moisture is essential for the biological degradation and groundwater assists the process except when it fills air voids and prevents the transport of oxygen to the refuse. Land fills of unsatisfactory design can be major sources of air, water and soil pollution.
Saturation vapour pressure:: The pressure exerted by a pure substance (at a given temperature) in a system containing only the vapour and condensed phase (liquid or solid) of the substance.
Scale:: In meteorology, the size of the system. Microscale processes are the subject of micrometeorology, synoptic scale processes are studied in synoptic meteorology, etc.
Scale height:: Distance given by <i>kT/mg</i> where <i>k</i> is the Boltzmann constant, <i>T</i> the temperature (K), <i>m</i> is the molecular mass, and <i>g</i> is the acceleration due to gravity. The scale height is equal to twice the distance through which a particle having kinetic energy <i>kT</i>/2 in the vertical direction can rise against the force of gravity.

For a homogeneous atmosphere it is related in theory to the meteorological range (<i>L</i><sub>v</sub>): <i>L</i><sub>v</sub> = 3.9/<i>b</i><sub>scat</sub>; <i>b</i><sub>scat</sub> and <i>b</i><sub>abs</sub> represent the scattering and absorption coefficients per unit length for a light beam (of path length <i>L</i>) which has a spectral radiance (intensity) <i>I</i><sub>o</sub> incident on a sample of air and <i>I</i> is the transmitted spectral radiance (intensity), ln(<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>/<i>I</i>) = <i>L</i>(<i>b</i><sub>scat</sub> + <i>b</i><sub>abs</sub>).
Scavenging:: The removal of pollutants from the atmosphere by natural processes, including scavenging by cloud water, rainout, and washout. This type of removal process is termed <i>precipitation scavenging</i>. Scavenging of airborne pollutants at surfaces of plant, soil, etc., is termed <i>dry deposition</i>.
Scrubber:: An apparatus used in sampling and in flue gas cleaning. The gas is passed through a space containing wetted "packing" or spray. In general, particles are collected in scrubbers by one or a combination of the following: impingement of particles on liquid medium; diffusion of the particles onto liquid medium; condensation of liquid medium vapours on the particles; partitioning of the gas into extremely small elements to allow collection of the particles by Brownian diffusion and gravitation settling on the gas-liquid interface. The devices include spray towers, jet scrubbers, Venturi scrubbers, cyclonic scrubbers, inertial scrubbers, mechanical scrubbers, and packed scrubbers. Normally the gas flow in the scrubber is counter to the liquid flow. Efficient scrubbers will collect particles as small as 1 to 2 &#109;m in diameter.	
Scrubbing:: A process used in gas sampling or gas cleaning in which components in the gas stream are removed by contact with a liquid surface or a wetted packing, on spray drops, droplets, or in a bubbler, etc.<i>Secondary pollution (emissions</i>): The products of the primary pollutants which form through photochemical and thermal reactions in the atmosphere (O<sub>3</sub>, peroxyacetyl nitrate, etc.).

Sink:: In atmospheric chemistry, the sink is the receptor for material which is removed from the atmosphere. Because of long range transport of many pollutants such as SO<sub>2</sub>, sulfuric acid and its salts, the sink region can be many hundreds of kilometers from the source region of the pollutants.	
Sintering:: The process by which fly ash produced in combustion of fuels such as coal, is baked (sintered) at a very high temperature. The sintered material is used in the manufacture of cinder blocks and other ceramic products. This term is also relevant to the enrichment of low grade ores and preparation of the charge for, e.g., a blast furnace. The sinter plant may be a significant source of pollution while serving to aid in the abatement of pollution for the blast furnace. <B>GB</B>: Coalescence of solid particles. Catalysts often suffer during use from a gradual increase in the average size of the crystallites or growth of the primary particles. This is usually called sintering.	
Smog:: The term originated in Great Britain as a popular derivation of "smoke-fog" and appears to have been in common use before World War I. It originally referred to the heavy pollution derived largely from coal burning (largely smoke filled air, rich in sulfur dioxide), and it probably was largely a reducing atmosphere. More common today in cities is an oxidising atmosphere which contains ozone and other oxidants; see <i>photochemical smog</i>.	
Smog alert:: Conditions indicated by meteorological forecasts, air sampiing, etc., where authorities responsible for air pollution control in a given area recommend or impose reduction of pollutant output by industry and other sources which contribute to the smog development. Alert levels of gaseous pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, ozone) ate considered indicative of an approach to danger to public health. Usually several levels of alert with increasing hazard are used. For example, Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District, uses an initial warning level, a second signal for curtailment of certain significant sources, and a third level at which emergency action must be taken.	::# can be determined under normal speech
Smog chamber:: A large confined volume in which sunlight or simulated sunlight is allowed to irradiate air mixtures of atmospheric trace gases (hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, etc.) which undergo oxidation. In theory these chambers allow the controlled study of complex reactions which occur in the atmosphere. However, ill-defined wall reactions which generate some molecular and radical species (e.g., HONO, CH<sub>2</sub>O, HO-radicals, etc.) and remove certain products (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, etc.), the use of reactant concentrations well above those in the atmosphere, ill-defined light intensities and wavelength distribution within the chamber, and other factors peculiar to chamber experiments require that caution be exercised in the extrapolation of results obtained from them to atmospheric systems.	
Smog index:: A mathematical correlation between smog and meteorological and/or pollutant concentrations associated with it. These are qualitative indices which are sometimes used in some urban communities to predict the degree of the air pollution which is expected for the coming day. See <i>smog alert</i>.	
Smoke:: A visible aerosol made up of small gas-borne particles resulting from the incomplete combustion of organic matter. It consists of carbon, carbon-rich products and all other dispersible product particles from the incomplete combustion. This does not include steam (condensed water vapour).	
Smoke abatement:: Legal measures which a control agency of a community may take to enforce laws and regulations concerning smoke emission.	
Smoke alarm:: An instrument which can provide an objective method of continuous measurement of the smoke density. Such devices are often depend upon the attenuation of light, and they can actuate an alarm when the attenuation exceeds some predetermined amount.	
Smokestack:: A chimney which carries the products of combustion away from a combustion chamber.
Smuts:: Agglomerates of soot that become detached from the wall of a chimney and are swept out by the flue gas and then fall in the vicinity of the stack.
Soiling:: Visible damage to materials by deposition of air pollutants.
Sol:: (<B>GB</B>) A fluid colloidal system of two or more components, e.g. a protein sol, a gold sol, an emulsion, a surfactant solution above the critical micelle concentration.
Solar radiation:: The electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. The total range of wavelengths of light emitted by the sun (99.9% in the range from 150 to 4000 nm) is filtered on entering the earth's atmosphere, largely through the absorption by oxygen, ozone, water vapour, and carbon dioxide. Near sea level only light of wavelengths longer than about 290 nm is present. The light from 290-400 nm is effective in inducing important photochemical processes since absorption by the important trace gases, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, aldehydes, ketones, etc., is significant in this region.
Solubility:: The maximum amount of material, pure solid, liquid, or gaseous compound (grams, mol, etc.) which will dissolve at equilibrium in a given amount of solvent (100 g, 1 kg, 1 litre of solution etc.) at a given temperature. The system is at equilibrium (at a fixed temperature) when the solution phase as well as the solid, liquid, or gas phase remain in contact indefinitely without further net change in amount of either phase. The solubility of gases in water is often considered in terms of Henry's law.
Solution:: A homogeneous mixture of two or more elements or compounds. The term may be applied to mixtures of solids as well as liquids, but unless stated otherwise, solution normally refers to a liquid medium (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in water). <B>GB</B>: A homogeneous liquid or solid phase containing more than one substance, when for convenience one of the substances, which is called the solvent and may itself be a mixture, is treated differently from the other substances, which are called solutes.
Soot:: Aggregations of black carbonaceous particles formed during incomplete combustion and which are deposited before being emitted from a chimney.
Sorption:: Process by which a substance (sorbate) is sorbed (adsorbed or absorbed) on or in another substance (sorbent); see also <i>absorption, adsorption, desorption</i>. <B>GB</B>: It is sometimes difficult or impossible to discriminate experimentally between adsorption and absorption: in such cases it is convenient to use the non-committal term sorption (together with its derived terms, <i>sorbent, sorbate, sorptive</i>).
Source:: In atmospheric chemistry, the place, places, or group of sites or areas where a pollutant is released into the atmosphere. Point sources, elevated sources, area sources, multiple sources are often identified.
Span:: Difference between the instrument readings for a stated value of air quality characteristic and a zero sample. By convention, this value of air quality characteristic is selected to be 95% of the upper limit of measurement.
Species:: In chemistry, a given kind of atom, molecule or radical which has a characteristic chemical structure and composition. <B>GB</B>: A chemical species is a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array or of chemically identical molecular entities that can explore the same set of molecular energy levels on the time scale of the experiment.
Specific gravity:: See <i>relative density</i>.
Spectrometry::Optical, in trace component analysis of air, methods of identification of substances and determination of their concentration based upon the measurement of light transmittance at selected wavelengths or bands of wavelengths; see also <i>mass spectrometry</i>.
Spheradiance:: Alternate term suggested for <i>Actinic flux</i>.
Spectrophotometry:: Methods using a photometer to measure light intensity as a function of wavelength.
Static stability:: In meteorology, the stability of the atmosphere in the vertical direction, to vertical displacements. If &#71; is the dry adiabatic lapse rate, dry air is stable if the lapse rate (&#151;d<i>T</i>/d<i>z</i>) &lt; &#71;, unstable if (d<i>T</i>/d<i>z</i>) &gt; &#71;, and neutral if &#151;(d<i>T</i>/d<i>z</i>) = &#71;; see <i>lapse rate</i> and <i>inversion</i>.
Stack:: See chimney.
Stack gas:: Gaseous waste products discharged to the atmosphere through a stack.
Stack height selection:: The degree of dispersion of the stack effluent increases with the height of the stack. The maximum ground level concentration of pollutants and the point from the stack at which this occurs are complex functions of the wind turbulence and other meteorological factors as well as stack height. There are physical and practical limitations which control the choice of stack height: cost, air traffic hazards, aesthetic considerations, aerodynamic factors, vibration, materials, etc. The tallest stack now in existence (1990) is that of the International Nickel Company of Canada (Sudbury, Ontario) which is 379.7 m tall, with a diameter of 35.5 m at the base and 15.8 m at the top. It weighs 3.901 x 10<sup>7</sup> kg. In recent years there has been less reliance on tall stacks for dispersing stack effluent and more concern for pollutant removal either before, during, or after combustion. This has been brought about through the realization that transport of certain pollutants such as SO<sub>2</sub> can occur over large distances and introduce problems such as acid deposition at receptor sites many hundreds of kilometers from the source.
Stack sampling:: Collection of representative gaseous and particulate samples of matter flowing through a duct or stack. Acceptable performance should indicate a collection efficiency of 95 ± 5 percent. Samples should be taken under isokinetic conditions to obtain an accurate representation of the particle size distribution in the effluent.
Stagnant inversion:: See inversion, temperature.
Standard:: An exact value, or a concept, that has been established by authority or agreement, to serve as a model or rule in the measurement of a quantity or in the establishment of a practice or procedure, in air pollutant analysis, standard reference gases, liquids, or solids are used to calibrate equipment. The concentrations of standards specified by a government agency or private laboratory must be based upon accurate measurement techniques which are verifiable through cross checks and the use of unambiguous methods.
Standard conditions:: Sometimes indicated with the abbreviation, STP. Temperature, 273.15 K (0 &#176;C) and pressure of 10<sup>5</sup> pascals. IUPAC recommends that the former use of the pressure of 1 atm as standard pressure (equivalent to 1.01325 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa) should be discontinued.
Standard deviation::&#115; A useful measure of the precision of the average of a series of <i>n</i> measurements (<i>x</i><sub>i</sub>) of the same quantity see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation for a full discussion. It is usual to report the "error limits" on an average estimate of a given quantity as ±1&#115; (67% confidence limits), ±2&#115; (95% confidence limits) or ±3&#115; (99.7% confidence limits). For applications involving small sample theory, a reference book on statistics should be consulted.
Stationary phase::In gas chromatography, Solid or liquid which has reversible sorption properties, for the components to be analysed. <B>GB</B>: The non-mobile phase in the chromatographic bed, on which the separation depends. For example, in gas-solid chromatography and liquid-solid chromatography the active solid, and in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid chromatography the liquid, but not the solid support.
Stratopause:: That region of the atmosphere which lies between the stratosphere and the mesosphere and in which a maximum in the temperature occurs.
Steady state:: A term used in reaction kinetics to describe the near constant (steady) concentration of reactive intermediate species in a reacting system when it is formed at a rate which is approximately equal to its rate of removal. In the atmosphere very reactive transient species such as O(<sup>1</sup>D) and HO have very short lifetimes and achieve a steady state in a very short time. Longer lived transient radicals (e.g., organylperoxyl radicals and NO<sub>3</sub>) and reactive molecules (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) achieve a steady state much more slowly (or never achieve one), since the rates of their formation and/or destruction may vary significantly during the lifetime of the species. The steady state concentration of a highly reactive species does adjust quickly to changes in the conditions such as the reactant concentrations, and, if the reactions forming or destroying the intermediate have a photochemical component, the actinic flux. In this case when the nearly constant concentration of the reactive transient is achieved, the system is said to be in a <i>photostationary state</i>.
Steric factor:: Term (<i>p</i>) used in the older literature to describe the make up of the preexponental factor (<i>A</i>) in the Arrhenius equation for the rate coefficient: <i>A</i> = <i>pz</i>, where <i>z</i> is the collision number and <i>p</i> represents the probability of correct orientation for reaction upon collision between two reactants.
Stochastic sampling:: Random sampling.
Stoichiometric:: Involving chemical combination in simple integral ratios. Characterized by having no excess of reactants or products over that required to satisfy the balanced chemical equation representing the given chemical reaction.
Stoker:: A machine for feeding coal into a furnace, and supporting it there during combustion.
Stokes law:: <i>F</i> = 6&#112;&#104;<i>rv</i>, where <i>F</i> is the force exerted on a sphere of radius <i>r</i> which is moving through a fluid of viscosity &#104; with a relative velocity <i>v</i>; this equation holds at low velocities which are free from turbulence (called the Stokes region).	
Stokes number::(St) Sometimes referred to as the inertial parameter; it is an index of the impactability of an aerosol particle. It is defined by the equation: <i>St</i> = 2&#116;(<i>V</i><sub>t</sub> &#151; <i>v</i><sub>t</sub>)<i>D</i><sub>p</sub> where <i>D</i><sub>p</sub> is the diameter of a small drop, <i>V</i><sub>t</sub> &#151; <i>v</i><sub>t</sub> is the difference in fall velocities of the drop and aerosol particles, and &#116; is the characteristic relaxation time of a particle.	
#Storage temperature, minimum:: The temperature below which the indicated uncertainty of the composition of the mixture may be altered, for example, for one of the following reasons: sorption of one or more components by the walls of the gas cylinder may occur; condensation of one or more components may occur.	::# not sufficiently important
#Storage temperature, maximum:: The temperature above which the indicated uncertainty of the composition of a standard substance or mixture may be altered because of physical, chemical, or physico-chemical reactions of the components of the mixture with each other or decompositions or reactions catalyzed at the wall of the gas cylinder.	::# not sufficiently important
STP:: Abbreviation for standard temperature (273.15 K or 0 &#176;C) and pressure (16 Pa); usually employed in reporting gas volumes. Note that flow meters calibrated in standard gas volumes per unit time often refer to volumes at 25 &#176;C, not 0 &#176;C. See also <i>standard conditions for gases</i>.	
Stratosphere:: The atmospheric shell lying just above the troposphere which is characterized by an increasing temperature with altitude. The stratosphere begins at the tropopause (about 10-15 km height) and extends to a height of about 50 km, where the lapse rate changes sign at the stratopause and the beginning of the mesosphere.	
#Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>):: A major oxidation product of sulfur-containing compounds in fuels and the major sulfur species emitted from power plants, furnaces, and other combustion sources. It is oxidized eventually to sulfuric acid and its salts in the atmosphere by reaction with HO-radicals in the gas phase, and more rapidly in cloud-water, rain, and in ground water, where it exists largely as HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ion, by reaction with dissolved H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and other oxidizing agents.	::# chem tagger
Supersaturation:: <i>a) In chemistry</i>, an unstable system which has a greater concentration of a material in solution than would exist at equilibrium is said to be supersaturated. <i>b) In meteorology</i>, supersaturation of an air mass with respect to H<sub>2</sub>O vapour is of special interest. It is the saturation ratio minus one, or the percent supersaturation is the percent relative humidity minus 100.	
Supersaturation:: <i>b) In meteorology</i>, supersaturation of an air mass with respect to H<sub>2</sub>O vapour is of special interest. It is the saturation ratio minus one, or the percent supersaturation is the percent relative humidity minus 100.	
Suspended matter:: All particulate material which persists in the atmosphere or in a flue gas stream for lengthy periods because the particles are too small in size to have an appreciable falling velocity.	
Synoptic scale:: In meteorology, the size or scale of ordinary weather systems or cyclones; typically 1000 km horizontally.	
Temperature:: The temperature measured on the thermodynamic scale, designated in kelvin (K); the term "absolute temperature" common in the older literature, is not recommended. Temperature (&#113;) measured on the Celsius scale is related to the thermodynamic temperature (<i>T</i>, K) by: &#113; /&#176;C = <i>T</i>/K &#151; 273.15.	
Thermosphere:: Atmospheric shell extending from the top of the mesosphere to outer space. It is a region of more or less steadily increasing temperature with height, starting at 70 or 80 km. It includes the exosphere and most or all of the ionosphere (not the D region).	
Titration:: The process of addition of a standard solution to a fixed volume of unknown solution usually from a buret, until the amount added is chemically equivalent to the substance being measured. This point is called the end point, which is often detected for solution titrations by an indicator that senses a minuscule excess of the standard solution. E.g., a standard base solution may be used to titrate the amount of acid in a sample of rain-water. Gas-phase titrations are also made with certain substances. E.g., the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> in a gaseous flow may be titrated by using a measured but variable flow of a standard mixture of NO; the maximum in the measured intensity of the chemiluminescence of the excited NO<sub>2</sub> formed (O<sub>3</sub> + NO --&gt; NO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> + O<sub>2</sub>; NO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> --&gt; NO<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&#110;</i>) is used to determine the end point.	
Titrimetric methods:: A class of volumetric analytical methods employing titration as the basis of quantitative measurement.	
Toxicity:: The quality of being poisonous. It may be expressed as a fraction indicating the ratio of the smallest mass of the material which has some specified probability (often 50%) of causing death of some specific animal to the mass of the animal.	
Tracer:: A foreign substance mixed with or attached to a given substance to enable the distribution or location of the latter to be determined subsequently. There are several types of tracers which are used: a) A physical tracer is one that is attached by physical means to the object being traced; 6) A chemical tracer is a chemical with properties similar to those of the substance being traced with which it is mixed homogeneously; c) An isotopic tracer is a unique isotope, either radioactive or an enriched, uncommon stable isotope, of the element to be traced; <i>d) A radioactive tracer</i> is a physical or chemical tracer having radioactivity as its distinctive property which allows detection at small concentrations and hence after large transport distances. The composition of aerosols in the troposphere has been used as a qualitative tracer of air masses. The elemental analyses (determined by neutron activation, X-ray fluorescence, etc.) of the aerosols transported from various sources or source regions sometimes have characteristic patterns which are used to define qualitatively the origin of tropospheric aerosols collected in other geographical regions.
Transfer line:: Line provided to carry the sample to be analysed from the sample point to the analytical unit without altering the composition of the sample.
Transition state:: (<B>GB</B>) In theories describing <i>elementary reactions</i> it is assumed that there is a transition state of more positive molar Gibbs energy between the reactants and the products through which an assembly of atoms (initially composing the <i>molecular entities</i> of the reactants) must pass on going from reactants to products in either direction. In the formalism of transition state theory the transition state of an elementary reaction is that set. of states (each characterized by its own geometry and energy) such that an assembly of atoms, when randomly placed there, would have an equal probability of forming the reactants or of forming the products of that elementary reaction. This set of states is characterized by the partition function for the transition state, The assembly of atoms at the transition state may be called an activated complex.
Transmittance:: The ratio of the transmitted spectral radiance (intensity), <i>I</i><sub>t</sub>, of monochromatic light (single wavelength or small band of wavelengths) to that of the incident spectral radiance (intensity), <i>I</i><sub>o</sub>: <i>I</i>t/<i>I</i><sub>o</sub>.
Troe expression:: A semi-empirical description of the rate coefficient for a specific three body reaction [e.g., HO + NO<sub>2</sub> (+ M) --&gt; HONO<sub>2</sub> (+ M)] which represents well its pressure and temperature dependence in the region of transition between second and third order kinetics.
Troposphere:: The lowest layer of the atmosphere, ranging from the ground to the base of the stratosphere (tropopause) at 10-15 km of altitude depending on the latitude and meteorological conditions. About 70% of the mass of the atmosphere is in the troposphere. This is where most of the weather features occur and where the chemistry of the reactive anthropogenic species released into the atmosphere takes place.
Tropopause:: The region of the atmosphere which joins the troposphere and stratosphere, and where the decreasing temperature with altitude, characteristic of the troposphere ceases, and the temperature increase with height which is characteristic of the stratosphere begins.
Turbidity:: Term used to indicate the degree of cloudiness of water samples which is caused primarily by the presence of colloidal matter. One unit of turbidity is defined as optical density of 0.001 (yellow light, 580 nm) per cm of depth.
Turbulence:: Atmospheric eddies, mechanical or thermal, which are produced primarily by shearing stress or by convection. Atmospheric turbulence is primarily responsible for the dilution and mixing of atmospheric pollutants. Turbulent fluctuation in stable air are mainly of high frequency with typical periods of seconds (mechanical turbulence). The fluctuation often constitute major deformations of flow and are capable of transporting momentum, energy, and suspended matter at rates far in excess of the rate of transport by molecular diffusion and conduction in a nonturbulent or laminar flow.
Undetermined components:: Components of the sample, the concentrations of which are not measured during the analysis.
Vacuum line:: Gas-tight system of tubing equipped with accessories such as valves, manometers, pumps, etc., which enable a gas to be transported from one point to another.
Variance:: A quantity, equal to the square of the standard deviation (&#115;<sup>2</sup>), used to measure precision of an average of a number of measurements of a quantity; see <i>standard deviation</i>.
Visibility:: Defined as the greatest distance at which a black object of suitable dimensions can be seen and recognized against the horizon sky, or, in the case of night observations, could be seen and recognized if the general illumination were raised to the normal daylight level. The criterion of recognizing the object, not just seeing the object without recognition, is used. Transmissometers, telephotometers, and sun photometers are devices used to measure the degree of transmission of light. Nephelometers (integrating) are used to measure visibility by way of the light scattering from aerosols in the air mass.
Volume measuring device:: Several different devices exist with which gas volumes are measured: <i>a) Dry test meter</i>. A device which consists of bellows and valves. Gas fills the bellows to a predetermined volume; this volume of gas is then released, and the bellows return to their original position. The cycle is repeated and the cyclic motion activates an indicator, <i>b) Wet test meter</i>: A device consisting of a cylindrical chamber divided into compartments. The cylinder is partially submerged in a fluid, usually water, and the gas to be measured enters below the water line. As the gas flows into a compartment the fluid is displaced and the cylinder turns. When one compartment has been filled the next one fills, and a continuous rotary motion of the cylinder results. The rotary motion is indicated on a dial.
Wash out:: The removal from the atmosphere of gases and sometimes particles by their solution in or attachment to rain-drops as they fall.
Wet bulb temperature:: In psychrometry, the temperature of the sensor or the bulb of a thermometer in which a constantly renewed film of water is evaporating. The temperature of the water used to renew the film must be at the temperature of the gas. See <i>psychrometry</i>.
Wind rose:: A diagram designed to show the distribution of wind direction experienced at a given location over a considerable period of time. Usually shown in polar coordinates (distance from the origin being proportional to the probability of the wind direction being at the given angle usually measured from the north). Similar diagrams are sometimes used to summarize the average concentrations of a given pollutant seen over a considerable period of time as a function of direction from a given site (sometimes called a <i>Pollution rose</i>).
Zero gas:: Substance or mixture of substances resembling, as closely as possible, the matrix of the actual air sample to be measured, but characterized by a value of the air quality characteristic which is not detectable by the method used.
Zero sample:: Substance or mixture of substances resembling, as closely as possible, the matrix of the actual air sample to be measured, but characterized by a value of the air quality characteristic which is not detectable by the method used.
