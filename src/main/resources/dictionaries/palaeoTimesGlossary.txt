Dryas:: The Younger Dryas stadial, also referred to as the Big Freeze,[1] was a geologically brief (1,300 ± 70 years) period of cold climatic conditions and drought which occurred between approximately 12,800 and 11,500 years BP (Before Present). The Oldest Dryas was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest stadial after the Weichselian glaciation in north Europe.
