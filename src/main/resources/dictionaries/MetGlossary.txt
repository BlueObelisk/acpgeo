Bulk Richardson Number (or BRN):: A non-dimensional number relating vertical stability and vertical shear (generally, stability divided by shear). High values indicate unstable and/or weakly-sheared environments; low values indicate weak instability and/or strong vertical shear. Generally, values in the range of around 50 to 100 suggest environmental conditions favorable for supercell development.

This acceleration results in a vertical circulation that creates divergence in the upper-level winds in the right half of the entrance region (as would be viewed looking along the direction of flow). This divergence results in upward motion of air in the right rear quadrant (or right entrance region) of the jet max. Severe weather potential sometimes increases in this area as a result.

A return flow aloft and subsidence over the eastern ocean complete the cell.
Wall Cloud:: A local and often abrupt lowering of a rain-free cumulonimbus base into a low-hanging accessory cloud, from 1 to 4 miles in diameter. The wall cloud is usually situated in the southwest portion of the storm below an intense updraft marked by the main cumulonimbus cloud and associated with a very strong or severe thunderstorm. When seen from several miles away, many wall clouds exhibit rapid upward motion and rotation in the same sense as a tornado, except with considerably lower speed. A rotating wall cloud usually develops before tornadoes or funnel clouds by a time which can range from a few minutes up to possibly an hour.
Warm Advection:: Transport of warm air into an area by horizontal winds. Low-level warm advection sometimes is referred to (erroneously) as overrunning.
Warm Front:: A narrow transitions zone separating advancing warmer air from retreating cooler air. The air behind a warm front is warmer and typically more humid than the air it is replacing.
Warning:: Forecast issued when a particular weather or flood hazard is "imminent" or already occurring (e.g., tornado warning, flash flood warning).  A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or property.
Warning Stage:: The level of a river or stream which may cause minor flooding, and at which concerned interests should take action.
Watch:: Forecast issued well in advance to alert the public of the possibility of a particular weather related hazard (e.g. tornado watch, flash flood watch). The occurrence, location and timing may still be uncertain.
Watch Box (or Box) :: A severe thunderstorm or tornado watch.
Water:: a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid; composed of hydrogen and oxygen.
Water Equivalent:: The liquid content of solid precipitation that has accumulated on the ground (snow depth). The accumulation may consist of snow, ice formed by freezing precipitation, freezing liquid precipitation, or ice formed by the refreezing of melted snow.
Water Vapor:: Water substance in a gaseous state that comprises one of the most important of all the constituents of the atmosphere.
Waterspout::  A rapidly rotating column of air extending from a cumulonimbus cloud with a circulation that reaches the surface of the water, (i.e. a tornado over water).
Wave:: In meteorology any pattern identifiable on a weather map that has a cyclic pattern, or, a small cyclonic circulation in the early stages of development that moves along a cold front.
Wave Crest:: The highest point in a wave.
Wave Trough:: The lowest point in a wave.
Wavelength:: Physical distance of one period (wave repeat).
Weather:: State of the atmosphere with respect to heat or cold, wetness or dryness, calm or storm, clearness or cloudiness. Also, weather is the meteorological day-to-day variations of the atmosphere and their effects on life and human activity. It includes temperature, pressure, humidity, clouds, wind, precipitation and fog.
Weather Balloon:: Large balloon filled with helium or hydrogen that carries a radiosonde (weather instrument) aloft to measure temperature pressure and humidity as the balloon rises through the air. It is attached to a small parachute so that when the balloon inevitably breaks, the radiosonde doesn't hurtle back to earth dangerously quickly.
Weather Synopsis:: a description of weather patterns affecting a large area.
Wedge (or Wedge Tornado) :: A large tornado with a condensation funnel that is at least as wide (horizontally) at the ground as it is tall (vertically) from the ground to cloud base.
WFO: Weather Forecast Office.  The Southern New England WFO is located in Taunton, MA. Other WFOs for the Northeast area located in Albany, NY, Gray, ME, and Upton, NY.
Whiteout:: A condition caused by falling and/or blowing snow that reduces visibility to nothing or zero miles; typically only a few feet. Whiteouts can occur rapidly often blinding motorists and creating chain-reaction crashes involving multiple vehicles. Whiteouts are most frequent during blizzards.
Wind:: Air in motion relative to the surface of the earth.
Wind Advisory:: Issued for sustained winds 31 to 39 mph for at least 1 hour or any gusts 46 to 57 mph.  However, winds of this magnitude occurring over an area that frequently experiences such winds would not require the issuance a wind advisory.
Wind Aloft:: The wind speeds and wind directions at various levels in the atmosphere above the area of surface.
Wind Chill::  The additional cooling effect resulting from wind blowing on bare skin. The wind chill is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by the combined effects of wind and cold.  The (equivalent) wind chill temperature is the temperature the body "feels" for a certain combination of wind and air temperature
Wind Chill Factor:: The apparent temperature which describes the cooling effect on exposed skin by the combination of temperature and wind, expressed as the loss of body heat. Increased wind speed will accelerate the loss of body heat.  The formula to calculate wind chill is: WC=.0817(3.71 V^.5 + 5.81 -.25 v)(T-91.4)+91.4 where V=wind speed in MPH and T=temperature F.
Wind Chill Advisory:: Issued when the wind chill index is expected to be between -25F and -39F for at least 3 hours.  This is using the wind chill of the sustained wind, not gusts.
Wind Chill Warning:: Issued when life-threatening wind chills of -40F or colder are expected for at least 3 hours.   This is using the wind chill of the sustained wind, not gusts.
Wind Direction:: The direction from which the wind is blowing.
Wind Shear:: Variation in wind speed and/or direction over a short distance. Shear usually refers to vertical wind shear, i.e., the change in wind with height, but the term also is used in Doppler radar to describe changes in radial velocity over short horizontal distances.
Wind Speed:: The rate at which air is moving horizontally past a given point.  It may be a 2-minute average speed (reported as wind speed) or an instantaneous speed (reported as a peak wind speed, or gust).
Wind Vane:: An instrument that determines the direction from which a wind is blowing.
Wind Wave:: A wave that is caused by the action of wind on the surface of water.
Windward:: Upwind, or the direction from which the wind is blowing; the opposite of leeward.
Winter Storm:: A heavy snow event. A snow accumulation of  more than 6 inches in 12 hrs or more than 12 inches in 24 hrs. 
Winter Storm Watch:: A significant winter storm may affect your area, but its occurrence, location and timing are still uncertain. A winter storm watch is issued to provide 12 to 36 hours notice of the possibility of severe winter weather. A watch will often be issued when neither the path of a developing winter storm nor the consequences of the weather
event are as yet well defined. Ideally, the winter storm watch will eventually be upgraded to a warning when the nature and location of the developing weather event becomes more apparent. A winter storm watch is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set plans in motion can do so.
Winter Storm Warning:: Issued when 7 or more inches of snow or sleet is expected in the next 24 hours, or 1/2 inch or more of accretion of freezing rain is expected.  A warning is used for winter weather conditions posing a threat to life and property.
Winter Weather Advisory:: Issued when 4, 5, or 6 inches of snow or sleet is expected in 24 hours; or any accretion of freezing rain or freezing drizzle is expected on road surfaces; or when blowing or drifting snow is expected to occasionally reduce visibility to 1/4 mile or less.
Wiresonde:: an atmospheric sounding instrument that is used to obtain temperature and humidity information between ground level and height of a few thousand feet; this instrument is supported by a captive balloon while traveling from the ground level.
World Meteorological Organization (WMO):: A specialized UN agency responsible for the establishment of meteorological stations and networks, and the monitoring of meteorological observations.
Wrapping Gust Front:: A gust front which wraps around a mesocyclone, cutting off the inflow of warm moist air to the mesocyclone circulation and resulting in an occluded mesocyclone.
WSR-88D:: Weather Surveillance Radar :: 1988 Doppler; NEXRAD unit.
Yellow Wind:: a strong, cold, dry west wind of eastern Asia that blows across the plains during winter and carries a yellow dust from the desert.
Youg:: a hot wind during unsettled summer weather in the Mediterranean.
Young Ice:: newly formed flat, sea or lake ice generally between two and eight inches thick.
Zigzag Lightning:: ordinary lightning of a cloud-to-ground discharge that appears to have a single lightning channel.
Zodiac:: the position of the sun throughout a year as it appears to move through successive star groups or constellations.
Zonal Flow (Zonal Wind):: Large-scale atmospheric flow in which the east-west component (i.e., latitudinal) is dominant.
Zone Of Maximum Precipitation:: The belt of elevation at which the annual precipitation is greatest in a mountain region.
Zulu time:: Same as UTC, Universal Coordinated Time.  Is is called Zulu because Z is often appended to the time to distinguish it from local time.
